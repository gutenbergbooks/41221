<p>The aim of the present work is to place within the reach of the
English reading historical student every portion of the Icelandic
Sagas essentially relating to the Pre-Columbian Discovery of America
by the Northmen. These Sagas are left, in the main, to tell their
own story; though, with the necessary introductions, notes have been
added, either to remove misconceptions, to give information in
regard to persons and places, or to show the identity of localities
described.</p>

<p>So long ago as the year 1838, a distinguished writer in the <i>North
American Review</i>, in closing a valuable and appreciative article on
the Sagas relating to America, said: "We trust that some zealous
student of these subjects will be immediately found, who will put
the Icelandic authorities into an English dress, and prepare them,
with proper literary apparatus, for the perusal of the general reader."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, no one in this country has really undertaken the
task until now; for the dialogues of Joshua Toulmin Smith, however
valuable they may have proved at the date of their publication,
can by no means be regarded as constituting the strict historical
work contemplated. The English treatise by Beamish was conceived
in the right spirit; but, while encumbered with much irrelevant
matter, it did not complete the subject, and, together with Smith's
work, long since went out of print. Several of the brief Narratives
are also given by Laing, buried in the appendix of his valuable
translation of the <i>Heimskringla</i>; but the labors of these authors are
not now available, and, if combined, would not meet the present
want. The author has therefore improved a favorable occasion to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>present what may, perhaps, be regarded as an exposition of the whole
question. In doing so he has freely made use of such material from
the above mentioned writers as he considered valuable for the purpose.
The brief translations of Laing, being well done, have been
given entire, with the exception that particular expressions have
been improved upon; but such portions of the unsatisfactory and
not altogether ingenuous work of Smith as have been used have
been somewhat thoroughly recast. A better use could have been
made of Beamish's work, if the author had succeeded in obtaining a
copy before he was on the point of closing up his work.</p>

<p>No critical knowledge of the Icelandic tongue is claimed by the
author, yet he hopes that the text of the Sagas has not here been
misinterpreted, or left obscure, especially as the Sagas relating to the
Pre-Columbian voyages are given in Professors Rafn's work on the
antiquities of America, accompanied by versions in Latin and Danish.
In everything relating to the latter tongue, the author has had the
invaluable assistance and advice of one who has spoken it from
childhood.</p>

<p>The grammatical structure of the Icelandic is simple, and the aim
has been throughout to maintain this simplicity in the translations,
so far as the genius of our own tongue would permit. This work
being strictly historical, both in spirit and design, the poetical extracts
which occur here and there are translated as literally as
possible, without any attempt to garnish them with metre and
rhyme. Nevertheless versions in rhyme, by other hands, are sometimes
given in the notes.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the author differs on some points from Professor
Rafn; yet it is believed that if he could have gone over the
subject again, studying it on the ground, and amid the scenes in
which so many of the exploits of the Northmen were performed, he
would have modified his views on some points.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the author has sought to strengthen several of
the conclusions of that noble and laborious investigator, and particu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>larly
by bringing out more fully the truthfulness of the Icelandic
descriptions of the coast of Cape Cod, which centuries ago presented
an aspect that it does not now possess.</p>

<p>And let us remember that in vindicating the Northmen we honor
those who not only give us the first knowledge possessed of the
American continent, but to whom we are indebted for much beside
that we esteem valuable. For we fable in a great measure when we
speak of our "Saxon inheritance." It is rather from the Northmen
that we have derived our vital energy, our freedom of thought, and,
in a measure, that we do not yet suspect, our strength of speech.
Yet, happily, the people are fast becoming conscious of their indebtedness;
so that it is to be hoped that the time is not far distant
when the Northmen may be recognized in their right, social, political
and literary characters, and at the same time, as navigators, assume
their true position in the Pre-Columbian Discovery of America.</p>

<h4>HISTORIC FANCIES.</h4>

<p>Before the plains of Europe, or even the peaks of Choumalarie,
rose above the primeval seas, the Continent of
America emerged from the watery waste that encircled
the whole globe, and became the scene of animate life.
The so-called New World is in reality the Old, and bears
abundant proofs of hoary age. But at what period it
became the abode of man we are unable even to conjecture.
Down to the close of the tenth century of the
Christian era it had no written history. Traces of a rude
civilization that suggest a high antiquity are by no means
wanting. Monuments and mounds remain that point to
periods the contemplation of which would cause Chronos
himself to grow giddy; yet among all these great and
often impressive memorials there is no monument, inscription,
or sculptured frieze, that solves the mystery of their
origin. Tradition itself is dumb, and the theme chiefly
kindles when brought within the realm of imagination.
We can only infer that age after age nations and tribes
continued to rise to greatness and then fall into decline,
and that barbarism and a rude culture held alternate sway.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, men have enjoyed no small degree of
satisfaction in conjuring up theories to explain the origin
of the early races on the Western Continent. What a
charm lingers around the supposed trans-Atlantic voyages
of the hardy Phenician, the luxurious sailors of Tyre, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
later, of the bold Basque. What stories might the lost
picture-records of Mexico and the chronicles of Dieppe
tell. Now we are presented with the splendid view of
great fleets, the remnant of some conquered race, bearing
across the ocean to re-create in new and unknown lands
the cities and monuments they were forever leaving
behind;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and now it is simply the story of some storm-tossed
mariner who blindly drives across to the western
strand, and lays the foundation of empire. Again it is
the devotee of mammon, in search of gainful traffic or golden
fleece. How romantic is the picture of his little solitary
bark setting out in the days of Roman greatness, or in the
splendid age of Charlemagne, sailing trustingly away
between the Pillars of Hercules, and tossing towards the
Isles of the Blessed and the Fountains of Eternal Youth.
In time the <i>Ultima Thule</i> of the known world is passed,
and favoring gales bear the merchant-sailor to new and
wondrous lands. We see him coasting the unknown
shores passing from cape to cape, and from bay to inlet,
gazing upon the marvels of the New World, trafficing with
the bronzed Indian, bartering curious wares for barbaric
gold; and then shaping his course again for the markets
of the distant East to pour strange tales into incredulous
ears. Still this may not be all fancy.</p>


<h4>THE SEA OF DARKNESS.</h4>

<p>In early times the Atlantic ocean, like all things without
known bounds, was viewed by man with mixed feelings
of fear and awe. It was called the Sea of Darkness. Yet,
nevertheless, there were those who professed to have some
knowledge of its extent, and of what lay beyond. The
earliest reference to this sea is that by Theopompus, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
fourth century before the Christian era, given in a fragment
of &AElig;lian,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> where a vast island is described, lying far
in the west, and peopled by strange races. To this we
may add the reference of Plato<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to the island called
Atlantis, which lay west of the Pillars of Hercules, and
which was estimated to be larger than Asia and Africa
combined. Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> also thought that many other lands
existed beyond the Atlantic. Plato supposed that the
Atlantis was sunk by an earthquake, and Crantor says
that he found the same account related by the Priests of
Sais three hundred years after the time of Solon, from
whom the grandfather of Critias had his information.
Plato says, that after the Atlantis disappeared navigation
was rendered too difficult to be attempted by the slime
which resulted from the sinking of the land. It is probable
that he had in mind the immense fields of drifting
sea-weed found in that locality, and which Humboldt estimates
to cover a portion of the Atlantic ocean six times as
large as all Germany.</p>

<p>It is thought that Homer<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> obtained the idea of his
Elysium in the Western ocean from the voyages of the
Phenicians, who, as is well known, sailed regularly to the
British Islands. They are also supposed by some to have
pushed their discoveries as far as the Western Continent.
Cadiz, situated on the shore of Andalusia, was established
by the Tyrians twelve centuries before the year of
Christ; and when Cadiz, the ancient Gadir, was full five
hundred years old, a Greek trader, Col&aelig;us, there bought
rare merchandise, a long and severe gale having driven
his ships beyond the Pillars of Hercules.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE PHENICIANS.</h4>

<p>In the ninth century before the Christian Era, the Phenicians
had established colonies on the western coast of
Africa; and three hundred years later, according to Herodotus,
Pharaoh Necho, son of Psammiticus, sent an expedition,
manned by Phenician sailors, around the entire
coast of Africa. Vivien de St. Martin fixes the date of this
expedition at 570 before Christ. St. Martin, in his account
of the voyage, improves slightly upon the views of Carl
M&uuml;ller, and is followed by Bougainville.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> This voyage,
performed by Hanno under the direction of Pharaoh, was
inscribed in the Punic language in a Carthagenian temple,
being afterwards translated into Greek, and was thus
preserved.</p>

<p>That the Canary Islands were discovered and colonized
by the Phenicians, there need be no doubt. Tradition
had always located islands in that vicinity. Strabo speaks
of the Islands of the Blessed, as lying not far from Mauritania,
opposite Gadir or Cadiz. And he distinctly says,
"That those who pointed out these things were <i>the Phenicians</i>,
who, before the time of Homer, had possession of
the best part of Africa and Spain."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> And when we
remember that the Phenicians sought to monopolize trade,
and hold the knowledge of their commercial resorts a
secret, it is not surprising that we should hear nothing
more of the Fortunate Isles until about eighty-two years
before Christ, when the Roman Sertorius met some Lusitanian
sailors on the coast of Spain who had just returned
from the Fortunate Isles. They are described as two
delightful islands, separated by a narrow strait, distant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
from Africa five hundred leagues. Twenty years after
the death of Sertorius, Statius Sebosus drew up a chart of a
group of five islands, each mentioned by name, and which
Pliny calls the Hesperides, including the Fortunate Isles.
This mention of the Canaries was sixty-three years before
Christ.</p>


<h4>JUBA'S EXPEDITION.</h4>

<p>When King Juba II returned to Mauritania, he sent an
expedition to the Fortunate Isles. A fragment of the narratives
of this expedition still survives in the works of Pliny.
They are described as lying southwest, six hundred and
twenty-five miles from Purpurari&aelig;. To reach them from
this place, they first sailed two hundred and fifty miles westward
and then three hundred and seventy-five miles eastward.
Pliny says: "The first is called Ombrios, and contains no
traces of buildings. There is in it a pool in the midst of
mountains, and trees like ferules, from which water may
be pressed, which is bitter from the black kinds, but from
the light kinds pleasant to drink. The second is called
Junonia, and contains a small temple built entirely of stone.
Near it is another smaller island having the same name.
Then comes Capraria, which is full of large lizards.
Within sight of these is Nivaria, so called from the snow and
fogs with which it is always covered. Not far from Nivaria
is Canaria, so called on account of the great number
of large dogs therein, two of which were brought to
King Juba. There were traces of buildings in these
islands. All the islands abound in apples, and in birds of
every kind, and in palms covered with dates, and in the
pine nut. There is also plenty of fish. The papyrus
grows there, and the silurus fish is found in the rivers."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
The author of <i>Prince Henry the Navigator</i>,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> says that in
Ombrios, we recognize the Pluvialia of Sebosus. Convallis
of Sebosus, in Pliny, becomes Nivaria, the Peak of
Teneriffe, which lifts itself up to the majestic height of
nine thousand feet, its snow-capped pinnacle seeming to
pierce the sky. Planaria is displaced by Canaria, which
term first applied to the great central island, now gives
the name to the whole group. Ombrios or Pluvialia,
evidently means the island of Palma, which had "a pool
in the midst of mountains," now represented by the crater
of an extinct volcano. This the sailors of King Juba
evidently saw. Major says: "The distance of this island
[Palma] from Fuerteventura, agrees with that of the two
hundred and fifty miles indicated by Juba's navigators as
existing between Ombrios and the Purpurari&aelig;. It has
already been seen that the latter agree with Lancerote and
Fuerteventura, in respect of their distance from the continent
and from each other, as described by Plutarch.
That the Purpurari&aelig; are not, as M. Bory de St. Vincent
supposed, the Madeira group, is not only shown by the
want of inhabitants in the latter, but by the orchil, which
supplies the purple dye, being derived from and sought
for especially from the Canaries, and not from the Madeira
group, although it is to be found there. Junonia," he
continues, "the nearest to Ombrios, will be Gomera. It
may be presumed that the temple found therein, was, like
the island, dedicated to Juno. Capraria, which implies
the island of goats, agrees correctly with the island of
Ferro, ... for these animals were found there in large
numbers when the island was invaded by Jean de Bethencourt,
in 1402. But a yet more striking proof of the
identity of this island with Capraria, is the account of the
great number of lizards found therein. Bethencourt's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
chaplains, describing their visit to the islands, in 1402,
state: 'There are lizards in it as big as cats, but they
are harmless, although very hideous to look at.'"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>We see, then, that the navigators of Juba visited the
Canaries<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> at an early period, as Strabo testifies was the
case with the Phenicians, who doubtless built the temple
in the island of Junonia. And, for aught we know,
early navigators may have passed over to the Western
continent and laid the foundation of those strange nations
whose monuments still remain. Both Phenician and
Tyrian voyages to the Western Continent, have been
warmly advocated; while Lord Kingsborough published
his magnificent volumes on the Mexican Antiquities, to
show that the Jews settled this continent at an early day.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
And if it is true that all the tribes of the earth sprang
from one central Asiatic family, it is more than likely
that the original inhabitants of the American continent
crossed the Atlantic, instead of piercing the frozen regions
of the north, and coming in by the way of Behring Straits.
From the Canaries to the coast of Florida, it is a short
voyage, and the bold sailors of the Mediterranean, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
touching at the Canaries, need only spread their sails
before the steady-breathing monsoon, to find themselves
wafted safely to the western shore.</p>


<h4>TRADITIONS.</h4>

<p>There was even a tradition that America was visited by
St. Columba,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and also by the Apostle St. Thomas,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> who
penetrated even as far as Peru. This opinion is founded
on the resemblance existing between certain rites and
doctrines which <i>seem</i> to have been held in common by
Christians and the early inhabitants of Mexico. The first
Spanish missionaries were surprised to find the Mexicans
bowing in adoration before the figure of the cross, and
inferred that these people were of a Christian origin. Yet
the inference has no special value, when we remember
that Christianity is far less ancient than the symbol of the
cross, which also existed among the Egyptians and other
ancient people.</p>

<p>Claims have also been made for the Irish. Broughton
brings forward a passage in which St. Patrick is represented
as sending missionaries to the Isles of America.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Another claim has been urged of a more respectable
character, which is supported by striking, though not
conclusive allusions in the chronicles of the North, in which
a distant land is spoken of as "Ireland the Great." The
Irish, in the early times, might easily have passed over to
the Western continent, for which voyage they undoubtedly
had the facilities. And Professor Rafn, after alluding to
the well known fact that the Northmen were preceded
in Iceland by the Irish, says, that it is by no means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
improbable that the Irish should also have anticipated
them in America. The Irish were a sea-faring people,
and have been assigned a Phenician origin by Moore and
others who have examined the subject.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> If this is so, the
tradition would appear to be some what strengthened.
Even as early as the year 296, the Irish are said to have
invaded Denmark with a large fleet. In 396, Niall made
a descent upon the coast of Lancashire with a considerable
navy, where he was met by the Roman, Stilicho,
whose achievements were celebrated by Claudian
in the days of the Roman occupation of England. At that
period the Irish were in most respects in advance of the
Northmen, not yet having fallen into decline, and quite
as likely as any people then existing to brave the dangers
of an ocean voyage.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The Icelandic documents, possibly
referring to the Irish, will be given in their proper place,
and in the meanwhile it need only to be added that the
quotation given by Beamish from such an authority as
the <i>Turkish Spy</i> will hardly tend to strengthen their
claims, especially where its author, John Paul Marana,
says that in Mexico "the British language is so prevalent,"
that "the very towns, bridges, beasts, birds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
rivers, hills, etc., are called by the British or Welch<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
names."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> In truth, as the wish is so often father to the
thought, it would be an easy task to find resemblance in
the languages of the aborigines to almost any language
that is spoken in our day.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the <i>probabilities</i> of the case, we
have no solid reason for accepting any of these alleged
voyages as facts. Much labor has been given to the
subject, yet the early history of the American continent
is still veiled in mystery, and not until near the close of
the tenth century of the present era can we point to a
genuine trans-Atlantic voyage.</p>


<h4>THE NORTHMEN.</h4>

<p>The first voyage to America, of which we have any
account, was performed by Northmen. But who were the
Northmen?</p>

<p>The Northmen were the descendants of a race that in
early times migrated from Asia and traveled towards the
north, finally settling in what is now the kingdom of Denmark.
From thence they overran Norway and Sweden, and
afterwards colonized Iceland and Greenland. Their language
was the old Danish (<i>D&ouml;nsk t&uacute;nga</i>) once spoken all
over the north,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> but which is now preserved in Iceland
alone, being called the Icelandic or old North,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
which is founded the modern Swedish, Danish and Norse
or Norwegian.</p>

<p>After the Northmen had pushed on from Denmark to
Norway, the condition of public affairs gradually became
such that a large portion of the better classes found their
life intolerable. In the reign of Harold Harfagr (the
Fair-haired), an attempt was made by the king to deprive
the petty jarls of their ancient udal or feudal rights, and
to usurp all authority for the crown. To this the proud
jarls would not submit; and, feeling themselves degraded
in the eyes of their retainers, they resolved to leave those
lands and homes which they could now hardly call their
own. Whither, then, should they go?</p>


<h4>THE COLONIZATION OF ICELAND.</h4>

<p>In the cold north sea, a little below the arctic circle, lay
a great island. As early as the year 860, it had been
made known to the Northmen by a Dane of Swedish
descent named Gardar, who called it Gardar's island,
and four years later by the pirate Nadodd, who sailed
thither in 864 and called it Snowland. Presenting in the
main the form of an irregular elipse, this island occupies
an area of about one hundred and thirty-seven square
miles, affording the dull diversity of valleys without verdure
and mountains without trees.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Desolation has there
fixed its abode. It broods among the dells, and looks
down upon the gloomy fiords. The country is threaded
with streams and dotted with tarns, yet the geologist finds
but little evidence in the structure of the earth to point to
the action of water. On the other hand, every rock and
hillside is covered with signs that prove their igneous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
origin, and indicate that the entire island, at some distant
period, has already seethed and bubbled in the fervent
heat, in anticipation of the long promised <i>Palingenesia</i>.
Even now the ground trembles in the throes of the earthquake,
the Geyser spouts scalding water, and the plain
belches mud; while the great jokull, clad in white robes of
eternal snow&mdash;true priest of Ormuzd&mdash;brandishes aloft
its volcanic torch, and threatens to be the incendiary of
the sky.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the land forms the homestead of
the reindeer and the fox, who share their domain with the
occasional white bear that may float over from Greenland
on some berg. Only two quadrupeds, the fox and the
moose, are indigenous. Life is here purchased with a
struggle. Indeed the neighboring ocean is more hospitable
than the dry land, for of the thirty-four species of mammalia
twenty-four find their food in the roaring main.
The same is true of the feathered tribes, fifty-four out of
ninety being water fowl. Here and there may be seen
patches of meadow and a few sheep pastures and tracts of
arable land warmed into fruitfulness by the brief summer's
sun; yet, on the whole, so poor is the soil that man, like
the lower orders, must eke out a scanty subsistence by
resorting to the sea.</p>

<p>It was towards this land, which the settlers called Iceland,
that the proud Norwegian jarl turned his eyes, and
there he resolved to found a home.</p>

<p>The first settler was Ingolf. He approached the coast
in the year 875, threw overboard his seat-posts,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
waited to see them touch the land. But in this he was
disappointed, and those sacred columns, carved with the
images of the gods, drifted away from sight. He nevertheless
landed on a pleasant promontory at the southeastern
extremity of the island, and built his habitation on
the spot which is called Ingolfshofdi to this day. Three
years after, his servants found the seat-posts in the southwestern
part of the island, and hither, in obedience to
what was held to be the expressed wish of the gods, he
removed his household, laying the foundation of Reikiavik,
the capital of this ice-bound isle. He was rapidly
followed by others, and in a short time no inconsiderable
population was gathered here.</p>

<p>But the first settlers did not find this barren country
entirely destitute of human beings. Ari Frode,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> than
whom there is no higher authority, says: "Then were
here Christian people, whom the Northmen called papas,
but they afterwards went away, because they would not be
here among heathens; and left behind them Irish books,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
and bells, and croziers, from which it could be seen that
they were Irishmen." He repeats substantially the same
thing in the <i>Landanama Book</i>, the authority of which, no
one acquainted with the subject, will question, adding that
books and other relics were found in the island of Papey
and Papyli, and that the circumstance is also mentioned
in English books. The English writings referred to are
those of the Venerable Bede. This is also stated in an
edition of King Olaf Tryggvesson's Saga, made near the
end of the fourteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The monks or Culdees, who had come hither from
Ireland and the Isles of Iona, to be alone with God, all
took their departure on the arrival of the heathen followers
of Odin and Thor, and the Northmen were thus
left in undisputed possession of the soil. In about twenty
years the island became quite thickly settled, though the
tide of immigration continued to flow in strongly for fifty
years, so that at the beginning of the tenth century Iceland
possessed a population variously estimated from sixty
to seventy thousand souls. But few undertook the voyage
who were not able to buy their own vessels, in which
they carried over their own cattle, and thralls, and household
goods. So great was the number of people who left
Norway at the outset that King Harold tried to prevent
emigration by royal authority, though, as might have
been predicted, his efforts were altogether in vain. Here,
therefore, was formed a large community, taking the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
shape of an aristocratic republic, which framed its own
laws, and for a long time maintained a genuine independence,
in opposition to all the assumptions and threats of
the Norwegian king.</p>


<h4>THE SETTLEMENT OF GREENLAND.</h4>

<p>But as time passed on, the people of Iceland felt a new
impulse for colonization in strange lands, and the tide of
emigration began to tend towards Greenland in the
west. This was chiefly inaugurated by a man named Eric
the Red, born in Norway in the year 935. On account
of manslaughter, he was obliged to flee from Jardar and
take up his abode in Iceland. The date of removal to
Iceland is not given, though it is said that at the time
the island was very generally inhabited. Here, however,
he could not live in peace, and early in the year 982, he
was again outlawed for manslaughter by the public Thnig,
and condemned to banishment. He accordingly fitted out
a ship, and announced his determination to go in search
of the land lying in the ocean at the west, which, it was
said, Gunnbiorn,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Ulf Krage's son, saw, when, in the year
876, he was driven out to sea by a storm. Eric sailed
westward and found land, where he remained and explored
the country for three years. At the end of this period he
returned to Iceland, giving the newly discovered land the
name of Greenland,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> in order, as he said, to attract settlers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
who would be favorably impressed by so pleasing a
name.</p>

<p>The summer after his return to Iceland, he sailed once
more for Greenland, taking with him a fleet of thirty-five
ships, only fourteen of which reached their destination,
the rest being either driven back or lost. This event took
place, as the Saga says, fifteen winters<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> before the introduction
of Christianity into Iceland, which we know was
accomplished in the year A. D. 1000. The date of Eric's
second voyage must therefore be set down at 985.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>But, before proceeding to the next step in Icelandic
adventure, it will be necessary to give a brief sketch of
the progress of the Greenland colony, together with a
relation of the circumstances which led to its final extinction.</p>


<h4>THE PROGRESS OF THE GREENLAND COLONIES.</h4>

<p>There is but little continuity in the history of the
Icelandic occupation of Greenland. We have already
seen that the second voyage of Eric the Red took place in
the year 985. Colonists appear to have followed him in
considerable numbers, and the best portions of the land
were soon appropriated by the principal men, who gave
the chief bays and capes names that indicated the occupants,
following the example of Eric, who dwelt in Brattahlid,
in Ericsfiord.</p>

<p>In the year 999, Leif, son of Eric, sailed out to Norway
and passed the winter at the court of King Olaf Tryggvesson,
where he accepted the Christian faith, which was
then being zealously propagated by the king. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
accordingly baptized, and when the spring returned the
king requested him to undertake the introduction of
Christianity in Greenland, urging the consideration that
no man was better qualified for the task. Accordingly he
set sail from Norway, with a priest and several members
of the religious order, arriving at Brattahlid, in Greenland,
without any accident.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> His pagan father was
incensed by the bringing in of the Christian priest, which
act he regarded as pregnant with evil; yet, after some
persuasion on the part of Leif, he renounced heathenism
and nominally accepted Christianity, being baptized by
the priest. His wife Thorhild made less opposition, and
appears to have received the new faith with much willingness.
One of her first acts was to build a church, which
was known far and wide as Thorhild's church.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> These
examples appear to have been very generally followed,
and Christianity was adopted in both Iceland and Greenland
at about the same period,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> though its acceptance
did not immediately produce any very radical change in
the spiritual life of the people. In course of time a number
of churches were built, the ruins of which remain
down to our own day.</p>

<p>In the year 1003, the Greenlanders became tributary to
Norway. The principal settlement was formed on the
western coast, and what was known as the eastern district,
did not extend farther than the southern extremity towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
Cape Farewell. For a long time it was supposed that
the east district was located on the eastern coast of
Greenland; but the researches of Captain Graah, whose
expedition went out under the auspices of the Danish
government, proved very conclusively that no settlement
ever existed on the eastern shore, which for centuries has
remained blocked up by vast accumulations of ice that
floated down from the arctic seas. In early times, as we
are informed by the Sagas, the eastern coast was more
accessible, yet the western shores were so superior in their
attractions that the colonist fixed his habitation there.
The site of the eastern settlement is that included in the
modern district of Julian's Hope, now occupied by a
Danish colony. The western settlement is represented
by the habitation of Frederikshab, Godthaab, Sukkertoppen
and Holsteinborg.</p>


<h4>THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH.</h4>

<p>In process of time the Christians in Greenland multiplied
to such an extent, both by conversions and by the immigration
from Iceland, that it was found necessary, in
the beginning of the twelfth century to take some measures
for the better government of the church, especially as
they could not hope much for regular visits from the
bishops of Iceland. They therefore resolved to make an
effort to secure a bishop of their own. Eric Gnupson, of
Iceland, was selected for the office, and proceeded to
Greenland about the year 1112, without being regularly
consecrated. He returned to Iceland in 1120, and afterwards
went to Denmark, where he was consecrated in
Lund, by Archbishop Adzer. Yet he probably never
returned to his duties in Greenland, but soon after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>
resigned that bishopric and accepted another,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> thus leaving
Greenland without a spiritual director.</p>

<p>In the year 1123, Sokke, one of the principal men of
Greenland, assembled the people and represented to them
that both the welfare of the Christian faith and their own
honor demanded that they should follow the example of
other nations and maintain a bishop. To this view they
gave their unanimous approval; and Einar, son of Sokke,
was appointed a delegate to the court of King Sigurd, of
Norway. He carried a present of ivory and fur, and a
petition for the appointment of a bishop. His mission
was successful, and in the year 1126 Arnald, the successor
of Eric,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> came into Greenland, and set up the Episcopal
seat at Gardar.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Torf&aelig;us and Baron Holberg,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> give a
list of seventeen bishops who ruled in Greenland, ending
with Andrew. The latter was consecrated and went
thither in 1408, being never heard of afterwards.</p>

<p>The history of Old Greenland is found in the <i>Ecclesiastical
Annals</i>, and consists of a mere skeleton of facts. As
in Iceland and Norway there was no end of broils and
bloodshed. A very considerable trade was evidently
carried on between that country and Norway, which is
the case at the present time with Denmark. As the land
afforded no materials for ships, they depended in a great
measure upon others for communication with the mother
countries, which finally proved disastrous.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span></p>

<h4>MONUMENTS AND RUINS.</h4>

<p>Their villages and farms were numerous. Together
they probably numbered several hundred, the ruins now
left being both abundant and extensive. Near Igaliko,
which is supposed to be the same as the ancient Einarsfiord,
are the ruins of a church, probably the cathedral of
Gardar. It is called the Kakortok church. It was of
simple but massive architecture, and the material was
taken from the neighboring cliffs. The stone is rough
hewn, and but few signs of mortar are visible. It is fifty-one
feet long and twenty-five wide. The north and
south walls are over four feet thick, while the end walls
are still more massive.</p>

<p>Nor are other monuments wanting. At Igalikko, nine
miles from Julian's Hope, a Greenlander being one day
employed in obtaining stones to repair his house, found
among a pile of fragments a smooth stone that bore,
what seemed to him, written characters. He mentioned
the circumstance to Mr. Mathieson, the colonial director
at Julian's Hope, who inferred that it must be a runic
stone. He was so fortunate as to find it afterwards, and
he accordingly sent it to Copenhagen, where it arrived in
the year 1830. The runes, which were perfectly distinct,
showed that it was a tombstone. The inscription was
translated as follows:</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">Vigdis Mars Daughter Rests Here.<br />
May God Gladden Her Soul.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">Another found in 1831, by the Rev. Mr. De Fries, principal
of the Moravian Mission, bore the following inscription
in the runic letter:</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Here Rests Hroar Kolgrimsson.</span>"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span></p>

<p class="noidt">This stone, now in the museum at Copenhagen, was found
built into the wall over the entrance of a Greenland house,
having been taken for that purpose from a heap of ruins,
about two miles north of Friederichsthal. This stone is
more than three feet long, being eighteen inches wide in
the narrowest part, and about five inches thick. It bears
every sign of a high antiquity.</p>

<p>But one of the most interesting remains which prove
the Icelandic occupation of Greenland is the runic stone
found by Parry, in 1824, in the island of Kingiktorsoak,
lying in 72&deg; 55&acute; N. and 56&deg; 51&acute; W. It contained a somewhat
lengthy inscription, and copies of it were sent to
three of the first scholars of the age, Finn Magnusson,
Professor Rask, and Dr. Bryniulfson, who, without consultation,
at once arrived at the same conclusion and united
in giving the following translation:</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">Erling Sighvatson and Biorn Thordarson and<br />
Eindrid Oddson, on Saturday before<br />
Ascension week, raised these<br />
marks and cleared<br />
ground. 1135.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a><br />
</p>

<p>The Icelandic colonists in Greenland do not appear to
have been confined to a small portion of territory. We
find considerable relating to this subject in the chronicle
attributed to Ivar Bert,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> the steward of one of the bishops
of Greenland; yet, though used extensively by Torf&aelig;us,
modern researches in this country prove that it is in some
respects faulty. In this chronicle, as in the Sagas, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
colonists are spoken of as possessing horses, sheep and
oxen; and their churches and religious houses appear to
have been well supported.</p>


<h4>EXPLORATIONS IN GREENLAND.</h4>

<p>Much was done, it appears, in the way of exploring the
extreme northern portions of the country known as
<i>Nordrsetur</i>. In the year 1266, a voyage was made under the
auspices of some of the priests, and the adventurers penetrated
north of Lancaster sound, reaching about the
same latitude that was attained by Parry in 1827. This
expedition was of sufficient importance to justify some
notice of it here. The account is found in <i>Antiquitates
American&aelig;</i> (p. 269), and it sets out with the statement that
the narrative of the expedition was sent by Haldor, a
priest, to Arnald, the chaplain of King Magnus in Norway.
They sailed out of Kroksfiardarheidi in an open
boat, and met with southerly winds and thick weather,
which forced them to let the boat drive before the wind.
When the weather cleared, they saw a number of islands,
together with whales and seals and bears. They made
their way into the most distant portion of the sea, and saw
glaciers south of them as far as the eye could reach.
They also saw indications of the natives, who were called
Skr&aelig;llings, but did not land, on account of the number of
the bears. They therefore put about, and laid their
course southward for nearly three days, finding more
islands, with traces of the natives. They saw a mountain
which they call Sn&aelig;fell, and on St. James day, July 25,
they had a severe weather, being obliged to row much and
very hard. It froze during the night in that region, but
the sun was above the horizon both day and night. When
the sun was on the southern meridian, and a man lay down

towards the sun would reach as far as his feet, which, of
course, indicates that the sun was very low. Afterwards
they all returned in safety to Gardar.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Rafn fixes the
position of the point attained by the expedition in the
parallel of 75&deg; 46&acute;. Such an achievement at that day
indicates a degree of boldness quite surprising.</p>


<h4>THE DECLINE OF GREENLAND.</h4>

<p>Of the reality and importance of the Greenland colony
there exists no doubt, notwithstanding the records are so
meagre and fragmentary.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> It maintained its connection
with the mother countries for a period of no less than four
hundred years; yet it finally disappeared and was almost
forgotten.</p>

<p>The causes which led to the suspension of communication
were doubtless various, though it is difficult to account for
the utter extinction of the colony, which does not appear
ever to have been in much danger from the Skr&aelig;llings.
On one occasion, in 1349 or later, the natives attacked the
western settlement, it is said, and killed eighteen Greenlanders
of Icelandic lineage, carrying away two boys captives.</p>

<p>We hear from the eastern colony as late as the middle
of the fifteenth century. Trade was carried on with
Denmark until nearly the end of the fourteenth century,
although the voyages were not regular. The last bishop,
Andreas, was sent out in 1406, and Professor Finn Magnussen
has established the fact that he officiated in the
cathedral at Gardar in 1409.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>From this time the trade between Norway and Greenland
appears to have been given up, though Wormius
told Peyrere of his having read in a Danish manuscript
that down to the year 1484 there was a company of more
than forty sailors at Bergen, in Norway, who still traded
with Greenland.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> But as the revenue at that time belonged
to Queen Margaret of Denmark, no one could go to Greenland
without the royal permission. One company of
sailors who were driven upon the Greenland coast, came
near suffering the penalty of the law on their return.
Crantz<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> says, that "about the year 1530, Bishop Amund
of Skalholt in Iceland is said to have been driven by a
storm, on his return from Norway, so near the coast of
Greenland by Heriulfness, that he could see the people
driving in their cattle. But he did not land, because just
then a good wind arose, which carried the ship the same
night to Iceland. The Icelander, Bi&aelig;rnvon Skardfa, who
relates this, also says further, that a Hamburgh mariner,
Jon Greenlander by name, was driven three times on the
Greenland island, where he saw such fisher's huts for
drying fish as they have in Iceland, but saw no men;
further, that pieces of shattered boats, nay, in the year
1625, an entire boat, fastened together with sinews
and wooden pegs, and pitched with seal blubber, have
been driven ashore at Iceland from time to time; and
since then they found once an oar with a sentence written
in Runic letters: '<i>Oft var ek dasa, dur elk drothik</i>,' that is,
'Oft was I tired when I drew thee.'"<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span></p>

<h4>LOST GREENLAND FOUND.</h4>

<p>But, whatever may be the value of the preceding extract,
it is clear that Greenland was never wholly forgotten. The
first person who proposed to reopen communication was
Eric Walkendorf, Archbishop of Drontheim, who familiarized
himself with the subject, and made every preparation
necessary in order to reestablish the colony; but, having
fallen under the displeasure of King Christian II, he left
the country and went to Rome, where he died in the year
1521. Thus his plans came to nothing.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Christian III
abrogated the decree of Queen Margaret, prohibiting trade
with Greenland without the royal permission, and encouraged
voyages by fitting out a vessel to search for Greenland,
which, however, was not found. In 1578, Frederic II
sent out Magnus Henningsen. He came in sight of the
land, but does not appear to have had the courage to
proceed further. Crantz, in his work on Greenland, gives
an account of a number of voyages undertaken to the coast,
but says that "at last Greenland was so buried in oblivion
that one hardly would believe that such a land as Greenland
was inhabited by Christian Norwegians."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>It remained, therefore, for Hans Egede,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> in 1721, to
reopen communication, and demonstrate the reality of the
previous occupation. Columbus himself did not meet
with greater trials and mortification than did this good
man for the space of eleven years, during which period he
labored to persuade the authorities to undertake the rediscovery.
But his faith and zeal finally overcame all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
hostility and ridicule, and on the second day of May,
1721, he went on board the Hope, with his wife and four
young children, and landed at Ball's river in Greenland
on the third of the following month. Here he spent the
best portion of his life in teaching the natives Christianity,
which had been first introduced seven centuries before,
and in making those explorations the results of which
filled the mind of Europe with surprise, and afforded a
confirmation of the truthfulness of the Icelandic Sagas.</p>


<h4>THE CHARACTER AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE NORTHMEN.</h4>

<p>Let us now return to the consideration of the Icelandic
voyages to the American Continent, though not
without first seeking a better acquaintance with the men
by whom they were performed.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the Northmen were a people
of no inferior attainments. Indeed, they constituted the
most enterprising portion of the race, and, on general
principles, we should therefore view them as fitted even
above all the men of their time for the important work
of exploration beyond the seas. They had made themselves
known in every part of the civilized world<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> by their
daring as soldiers and navigators. Straying away into
the distant east from whence they originally came, we see
them laying the foundation of the Russian empire, swinging
their battle-axes in the streets of Constantinople,
carving their mystic runes upon the Lions of the Areopagus,
and filling the heart of even the great Charlemagne
with dismay. Says Dasent, when summing up their
achievements: "In Byzantium they are the leaders of the
Greek emperor's body guard, and the main support of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
tottering throne. From France, led by Rollo, they tear
away her fairest province and found a long line of kings.
In Saxon England they are the bosom friends of such kings
as Athelstane, and the sworn foes of Ethelred the Unready.
In Danish England they are the foremost among the
thanes of Canute, Swein and Hardicanute, and keep down
the native population with an iron heel. In Norman
England," he continues, "the most serious opposition the
conqueror meets with is from the colonists of his own
race settled in Northumbria. He wastes their lands with
fire and sword, and drives them across the border, where
we still find their energy, their perseverance, and their
speech existing in the lowland Scotch. In Norway they
dive into the river with King Olaf Tryggvesson, the best
and strongest champion of his age, and hold him down
beneath the waves so long that the bystanders wonder
whether either king or Icelander will ever reappear on
the surface.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Some follow Saint Olaf in his crusades
against the old [pagan] faith.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Some are his obstinate
foes, and assist at his martyrdom. Many follow Harold
the Stern to England when he goes to get his 'seven feet'
of English earth, and almost to a man they get their
portion of the same soil, while their names grow bright
in song and story." And finally, "From Iceland as a
base, they push on to Greenland and colonize it: nay, they
discover America in those half-decked barks."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>


<h4>THE SHIPS OF THE NORTHMEN.</h4>

<p>The Northmen were excellent navigators. They were,
moreover, it has been claimed, the first to learn the art
of sailing on the wind. They had good sea-going vessels,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>
some of which were of large size. We have an account
in the Saga of Olaf Tryggvesson of one that in some
respects was remarkable. It is said that "the winter after
King Olaf Tryggvesson came from Halogeland. He had a
great ship built at Ledehammer,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> which was larger than
any ship in the country, and of which the beam-knees are
still to be seen. The length of the keel that rested upon
the grass was seventy-four ells. Thorberg Skafting was
the man's name who was the master builder of the ship,
but there were many others besides; some to fell the
wood, some to shape it, some to make nails, some to carry
timber, and all that was used was the best. The ship
was both long and broad and high sided, and strongly
timbered.... The ship was a dragon, built after the one
that the king had captured in Halogaland, but it was
far longer and more carefully put together in all her parts.
The Long Serpent [her name] had thirty-four benches
for rowers. The head and arched tail were both gilt, and
the bulwarks were as high as in sea-going ships. This ship
was the best and most costly ever built in Norway."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span></p>

<p>Laing computes the tonnage of this ship at about nine
hundred and forty-two tons, thus giving a length of about
one hundred feet, which is nearly the size of a forty-two
gun ship. By steam tonnage it would give a capacity of
a little less than three hundred tons, and one hundred and
twenty horse power. We apprehend, however, that the
estimate is sufficiently large; yet we are not concerned to
show any great capacity for the Icelandic ships. All the
vessels employed in the early times on the American
coasts were small. Cabot sailed in Baffins Bay with a
vessel of thirty tons; and the Anna Pink, the craft that
accompanied Lord Anson in his expedition around the
world, was only sixteen tons.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The vessels possessed by
the Northmen were everyway adapted for an ocean voyage.</p>

<p>In nautical knowledge, also, they were not behind the
age. The importance of cultivating the study of navigation
was fully understood. The Raudulf of Oesterdal, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
Norway, taught his son to calculate the course of the sun
and moon, and how to measure time by the stars. In
1520 Olaus Magnus complained that the knowledge of the
people in this respect had been diminished. In that noble
work called <i>Speculum Regale</i> the Icelander is taught to
make an especial study of commerce and navigation, of
the divisions of time and the movements of the heavenly
bodies, together with arithmetic, the rigging of vessels
and <i>morals</i>.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Without a high degree of knowledge they
could never have achieved their eastern voyages.</p>


<h4>THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA.</h4>

<p>We find that the Northmen were well acquainted with
other parts of the world, and that they possessed all the
means of reaching the continent in the west. We come,
therefore, to the question: Did the Northmen actually
discover and explore the coast of the country now known
as America?</p>

<p>No one can say that the idea wears any appearance of
<i>improbability</i>; for there is certainly nothing wonderful in
the exploit. And after conceding the fact that the
colonies of the Northmen existed in Greenland for at
least three hundred years we must prepare ourselves for
something of this kind. Indeed it is well nigh, if not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>
altogether unreasonable, to suppose that a sea-faring people
like the Northmen could live for three centuries within a
short voyage of this vast continent, and never become
aware of its existence. A supposition like this implies a
rare credulity, and whoever is capable of believing it
must be capable of believing almost anything.</p>

<p>But on this point we are not left to conjecture. The
whole decision, in the absence of monuments like those
of Greenland, turns upon a question of <i>fact</i>. The point is
this: <i>Do the manuscripts which describe these voyages belong
to the pre-Columbian age?</i> If so, then the Northmen are
entitled to the credit of the prior discovery of America.
That these manuscripts belong to the pre-Columbian age,
is as capable of demonstration as the fact that the writings
of Homer existed prior to the age of Christ. Before
intelligent persons deny either of these points they must
first succeed in blotting out numberless pages of well
known history. The manuscript in which we have versions
of all the Sagas relating to America is found in the
celebrated <i>Codex Flat&ouml;iensis</i>, a work that was finished in
the year 1387, or 1395 at the latest. This collection, made
with great care and executed in the highest style of art,
is now preserved in its integrity<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> in the archives of Copenhagen.
These manuscripts were for a time supposed to
be lost, but were ultimately found safely lodged in their
repository in the monastery library of the island of Flat&ouml;,
from whence they were transferred to Copenhagen with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>
large quantity of other literary material collected from
various localities. If these Sagas which refer to America
were interpolations, it would have early become apparent,
as abundant means exist for detecting frauds; yet those
who have examined the whole question do not find any
evidence that invalidates their historical statements. In
the absence, therefore, of respectable testimony to the
contrary, we accept it as a fact that the Sagas relating to
America are the productions of the men who gave them
in their present form nearly, if not quite, an entire century
before the age of Columbus.</p>

<p>It might also be argued, if it were at all necessary, that,
if these Sagas were post-Columbian compositions drawn
up by Icelanders who were jealous of the fame of the
Geneose navigator, we should certainly be able to point
out something either in their structure, bearing, or style
by which it would be indicated. Yet such is not the case.
These writings reveal no anxiety to show the connection
of the Northmen with the great land lying at the west.
The authors do not see anything at all remarkable or
meritorious in the explorations, which were conducted
simply for the purpose of gain. Those marks which would
certainly have been impressed by a more modern writer
forging a historical composition designed to show an
occupation of the country before the time of Columbus,
are wholly wanting. There is no special pleading or
rivalry, and no desire to show prior and superior knowledge
of the country to which the navigators had from
time to time sailed. We only discover a straightforward,
honest endeavor to tell the story of certain men's lives.
This is done in a simple, artless way, and with every indication
of a desire to mete out even handed justice to all.
And candid readers who come to the subject with minds
free from prejudice, will be powerfully impressed with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>
belief that they are reading authentic histories written
by honest men.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>


<h4>THE LITERATURE OF ICELAND.</h4>

<p>Before speaking particularly of the substance of the
Sagas it will be necessary to trace briefly the origin and
history of Icelandic literature in general.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the fact that Iceland was
mainly settled by Norwegians of superior qualities. And
this superiority was always maintained, though it was somewhat
slow in manifesting itself in the form of literature.
Prior to the year 1000, the Runic alphabet had existed in
Iceland, but it was generally used for the simplest pur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>poses.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
History and literature derived no advantage, as
the runes were used chiefly for monumental inscriptions,
and for mottoes and charms on such things as drinking cups,
sacrifical vessels and swords. Yet the people were not
without a kind of intellectual stimulus. It had long been
the custom to preserve family and general histories, and
recite them from memory as occasion seemed to warrant.
This was done with a wonderful degree of accuracy and
fidelity, by men more or less trained for the purpose, and
whose performances at times were altogether surprising.
They also had their scalds or poets, who were accustomed
both to repeat the old songs and poems and extemporize<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span>
new ones. Every good fighter was expected to prove
himself a poet when the emergency required it. This profession
was strongly encouraged. When Eyvind Skialdespilder
sang his great song in praise of Iceland every
peasant in the island, it is said, contributed three pieces of
silver to buy a clasp for his mantel of fifty marks weight.
These scalds were sometimes employed by the politicians,
and on one occasion a satire so nettled Harold, king of
Denmark, that he sent a fleet to ravage the island, and
made the repetition an offense punishable with death.
These poets also went to England, to the Orkneys and to
Norway, where at the king's court they were held in the
highest estimation, furnishing poetical effusions on every
public or private occasion which demanded the exercise of
their gifts. The degree to which they had cultivated their
memories was surprising. Old Blind Skald Stuf could
repeat between two and three hundred poems without
halting; while the Saga-men had the same power of
memory, which we know may be improved to almost any
extent by cultivation. But with the advent of Christianity
came the Roman alphabet, which proved an easy method
of expressing thought. Christianity, however, did not
stop here. Its service was a reasonable service, and
demanded of its votaries a high intelligence. The priest
of Odin need do no more than to recite a short vow, or
mutter a brief prayer. He had no divine records to read
and to explain. But the minister of the new religion came
with a system that demanded broader learning and culture
than that implied in extemporaneous songs. His
calling required the aid of books, and the very sight of
such things proved a mental stimulus to this hard-brained
race. Besides, Christianity opened to the minds of the
people new fields of thought. These rude sons of war soon
began to understand there were certain victories, not to
be despised, that might be gained through peace, and soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span>
letters came to be some what familiar to the public mind.
The earliest written efforts very naturally related to the
lives of the Saints, which on Sundays and holy days were
read in public for the edification of the people. During
the eleventh century these exercises shared the public
attention with those of the professional Saga-man, who
still labored to hand down the oral versions of the national
history and traditions. But in the beginning of the
twelfth century the use of letters was extended, and, ere-long,
the Saga-man found his occupation gone, the national
history now being diligently gathered up by zealous
students and scribes and committed to the more lasting
custody of the written page. Among these was Ari Frode,
who began the compilation of the Icelandic <i>Dooms-day
Book</i>, which contained the records of all the early settlers.
Scarcely less useful was S&aelig;mund the Wise, who collected
the poetical literature of the North and arranged it in a
goodly tome. The example of these great men was
followed, and by the end of the twelfth century all the
Sagas relating to the pagan period of the country had been
reduced to writing. This was an era of great literary
activity, and the century following showed the same zeal.
Finally Iceland possessed a body of prose literature superior
in quantity and value to that of any other modern
nation of its time.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Indeed, the natives of Europe at this
period had no prose or other species of literature hardly
worthy of the name; and, taken altogether, the Sagas
formed the first prose literature in any modern language
spoken by the people.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Says Sir Edmund Head, "No
doubt there were translations in Anglo-Saxon from the
Latin, by Alfred, of an earlier date, but there was in truth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>
no vernacular literature. I cannot name," he says, "any
work in high or low German prose which can be carried
back to this period. In France, prose writing cannot be
said to have begun before the time of Villehardouin (1204),
and Joinville (1202). Castilian prose certainly did not
commence before the time of Alfonso X (1252). Don
Juan Manvel, the author of the <i>Conde Lucanor</i>, was not
born till 1282. The <i>Cronica General de Espa&ntilde;a</i> was not
composed till at least the middle of the thirteenth century.
About the same time the language of Italy was acquiring
that softness and strength which were destined to appear
so conspicuously in the prose of Boccaccio, and the writers
of the next century."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Yet while other nations were without a literature the
intellect of Iceland was in active exercise, and works were
produced like the <i>Eddas</i> and the <i>Heimskringla</i>, works
which being inspired by a lofty genius will rank with the
writings of Homer and Herodotus while time itself endures.</p>

<p>But in the beginning of the sixteenth century the literature
of Iceland ultimately reached the period of its greatest
excellence and began to decline. Books in considerable
numbers always continued to be written, though works of
positive genius were wanting. Yet in Iceland there has
never been an absence of literary industry, while during
the recent period the national reputation has been sustained
by Finn Magnussen and similar great names. One
hundred years before the Plymouth colonists, following in
the track of Thorwald Ericson, landed on the sands of Cape
Cod, the people of Iceland had set up the printing press,
and produced numerous works both in the native language
and the Latin tongue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span></p>

<p>It is to this people, whom Saxo Grammaticus points out
as a people distinguished for their devotion to letters, that
we are indebted for the narratives of the pre-Columbian
voyages to America. Though first arranged for oral recitation,
these Sagas were afterwards committed to manuscript,
the earliest of which do not now exist, and were
finally preserved in the celebrated Flat&ouml; collection nearly
a century before the rediscovery of America by Columbus.</p>

<p>But it is no longer necessary to spend much time on
this point, since the character and value of the Icelandic
writings have come to be so generally acknowledged, and
especially since scholars and antiquarians like Humbolt
have fully acknowledged their authenticity and authority.</p>

<p>It is proper to notice here the fact that not a few have
imagined that the claims of the Northmen have been
brought forward to detract from the fame of Columbus;<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
yet, nothing could be farther from the truth, since no one
denies that it was by the discovery of America by Columbus
that the continent first became of value to the Old
World. The Northmen came and went away without
accomplishing any thing of lasting value; yet, because the
world at large derived no benefit from their discovery, it is
certainly unjust to deny its reality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact that the Northmen knew of the existence of
the Western Continent, prior to the age of Columbus, was
prominently brought before the people of this country in
the year 1837, when the Royal Society of Northern Antiquarians
at Copenhagen published their work on the
Antiquities of North America, under the editorial supervision
of that great Icelandic scholar, Professor Rafn. But
we are not to suppose that the first general account of
these voyages was then given, for it has always been
known that the history of certain early voyages to America
by the Northmen were preserved in the libraries of Denmark
and Iceland.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Torf&aelig;us, as early as 1706, published
his work on Greenland, which threw much light on the
subject. We find accounts of these discoveries in the
works of Egede and Crantz. A very intelligent sketch,
at least for those times, was given by J. Reinhold Forster,
who frankly concedes the pre-Columbian discovery
of America, in a <i>History of the Voyages and Discoveries
made in the North</i>. Robertson speaks of them in his
<i>History of America</i>, but says that he is unable to give an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span>
intelligent opinion. Indeed, the most of the older and
more comprehensive writers give the Northmen recognition.
Yet, owing to the fact that the Icelandic language,
though simple in construction and easy of acquisition, was
a tongue not understood by scholars, the subject has
until recent years been suffered to lie in the back ground,
and permitted, through a want of interest, to share, in a
measure, the treatment meted out to vague and uncertain
reports. But the well-directed efforts of the Northern
Antiquarians of Denmark, supported by the enlightened
zeal of scholars and historians in England, France and
Germany, have done much to dispel popular ignorance,
and to place the whole question in its true bearing before
the people of all the principal civilized nations. In our
own country, the work of Professor Rafn, already alluded
to, has created a deep and wide-spread conviction of the
reality of the Northman's claim, and has elicited confessions
like that of Palfrey, who is obliged to say of the
Icelandic records that, "their antiquity and genuineness
appear to be well established, nor is there anything to
bring their credibility into question, beyond the general
doubt which always attaches to what is new or strange."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>


<h4>THE NARRATIVES.</h4>

<p>It now remains to give the reader some general account
of the contents of the narratives which relate more or less
to the discovery of the Western continent. In doing this,
the order followed will be that which is indicated by the
table of contents at the beginning of the volume.</p>

<p>The first extracts given are very brief. They are taken
from the <i>Landanama Book</i>, and relate to the report in
general circulation, which indicated one Gunnbiorn as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span>
discoverer of Greenland, an event which has been fixed
at the year 876. These fragments also give an account of
a voyage to what was called Gunnbiorn's Rocks, where
the adventurers passed the winter, and found in a hole, or
excavation, a sum of money, which indicated that others
had been there before them.</p>

<p>The next narrative relates to the rediscovery of Greenland
by the outlaw, Eric the Red, in 983, who there passed
three years in exile, and afterwards returned to Iceland.
About the year 986, he brought out to Greenland a
considerable colony of settlers, who fixed their abode at
Brattahlid, in Ericsfiord.</p>

<p>Then follows two versions of the voyage of Biarne
Heriulfson, who, in the same year, 986, when sailing for
Greenland, was driven away during a storm, and saw a
new land at the southward, which he did not visit.</p>

<p>Next is given three accounts of the voyage of Leif, son
of Eric the Red, who in the year 1000 sailed from Brattahlid
to find the land which Biarne saw. Two of these
accounts are hardly more than notices of the voyage, but
the third is of considerable length, and details the successes
of Leif, who found and explored this new land, where
he spent the winter, returning to Greenland the following
spring.</p>

<p>After this follows the voyage of Thorvald Ericson,
brother of Leif, who sailed to Vinland from Greenland,
which was the point of departure in all these voyages.
This expedition was begun in 1002, and it cost him his
life, as an arrow from one of the natives pierced his side,
causing death.</p>

<p>Thorstein, his brother, went to seek Vinland, with the
intention of bringing home his body, but failed in the
attempt, and was driven back, passing the winter in a
part of Greenland remote from Brattahlid, where he died
before the spring fully opened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span></p>

<p>The most distinguished explorer was Thorfinn Karlsefne,
the Hopeful, an Icelander whose genealogy runs back
in the old Northern annals, through Danish, Swedish, and
even Scotch and Irish ancestors, some of whom were of
royal blood. In the year 1006 he went to Greenland, where
he met Gudrid, widow of Thorstein, whom he married.
Accompanied by his wife, who urged him to the undertaking,
he sailed to Vinland in the spring of 1007, with
three vessels and one hundred and sixty men, where he
remained three years. Here his son Snorre was born. He
afterwards became the founder of a great family in Iceland,
which gave the island several of its first bishops. Thorfinn
finally left Vinland because he found it difficult to sustain
himself against the attacks of the natives. They spent
the most of their time in the vicinity of Mount Hope Bay
in Rhode Island. Of this expedition we have three narratives,
all of which are given.</p>

<p>The next to undertake a voyage was a wicked woman
named Freydis, a sister to Leif Ericson, who went to Vinland
in 1011, where she lived for a time with her two
ships' crews in the same places occupied by Leif and
Thorfinn. Before she returned, she caused the crew of
one ship to be cruelly murdered, assisting in the butchery
with her own hands.</p>

<p>After this we have what are called the Minor Narratives,
which are not essential, yet they are given that the reader
may be in the possession of all that relates to the subject.
The first of these refers to a voyage of Are Marson to a
land southwest of Ireland, called Hvitrammana-land, or
Great Ireland. This was prior to Leif's voyage to Vinland,
or New England, taking place in the year 983.
Biorn Asbrandson is supposed to have gone to the same
place in 999. The voyage of Gudleif, who went thither, is
assigned to the year 1027. The narrative of Asbrandson
is given for the sake of the allusion at the close.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally we have a few scraps of history which speak of
a voyage of Bishop Eric to Vinland in 1121, of the rediscovery
of Helluland (Newfoundland) in 1285, and of a
voyage to Markland (Nova Scotia) in 1347, whither the
Northmen came to cut timber. With such brief notices
the accounts come to an end.</p>


<h4>THE TRUTHFULNESS OF THE NARRATIVES.</h4>

<p>The reader will occasionally find in these narratives
instances of a marvelous and supernatural character, but
there is nothing at all mythological, as persons ignorant of
their nature have supposed. Besides there are multitudes
of narratives of a later date, to be found in all languages,
which contain as many statements of a marvelous nature
as these Sagas, which are nevertheless believed to contain a
substantial and reliable ground-work of truth. All early
histories abound in the supernatural, and these things are
so well known that illustrations are hardly needed here.
The relation of prodigies in no wise destroys the credibility
of historical statement. If this were not so, we should be
obliged to discard the greater portion of well known
history, and even suspect plain matters of fact in the
writings of such men as Dr. Johnson, because that great
scholar fully believed in the reality of an apparition known
in London as the Cock-Lane Ghost. The Sagas are as
free from superstition and imagination as any other reliable
narratives of that age, and just as much entitled to
belief.</p>

<p>There will also, in certain cases, be found contradictions.
The statements of the different narratives do not
always coincide. The disagreements are, however, neither
very numerous nor remarkable. The discrepancies are
exactly what we should expect to find in a series of narratives,
written at different times and by different hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span>
The men who recorded the various expeditions to New
England in the eleventh century agree, on the whole,
quite as well as the writers of our own day, who, with
vastly greater advantages, undertake to narrate the events
of the second colonization in the seventeenth century.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Therefore these marvelous statements and occasional
contradictions in nowise detract from the historic value of
the documents themselves, which, even in their very
truthfulness to the times, give every evidence of authenticity
and great worth. To this general appearance of
truthfulness we may, however, add the force of those
undesigned coincidences between writers widely separated
and destitute of all means of knowing what had been
already said. The same argument may be used with
the Sagas which has been so powerfully employed by
Paley and others in vindicating the historical character of
the New Testament. In these narratives, as in those of
Paul and John, it may be used with overwhelming effect.
Yet we do not fear to dispense with all auxiliary aids.
We are willing <i>to rest the whole question of the value of these
narratives upon their age</i>; for if the Sagas date back to a
period long prior to the voyage of Columbus, then the
Northmen are entitled to the credit of having been the
first Europeans to land upon these shores. But the date<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span>
of these narratives has now been settled beyond reasonable
question. The doubts of the ablest critical minds, both in
Europe and America, have been effectually laid to rest,
and the only reply now given to the Northern Antiquarian
is some feeble paragraph pointed with a sneer.</p>

<p>We need not, therefore, appear before the public to cry,
Place for the Northmen. They can win their <i>own</i> place, as
of old. They are as strong to-day in ideas, as anciently
in arms.</p>


<h4>THE ABSENCE OF MONUMENTS AND REMAINS.</h4>

<p>That the Northmen left no monuments or architectural
remains in New England is true, notwithstanding Professor
Rafn supposed that he found in the celebrated
Dighton rock<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and the stone mill at Newport, indubitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[Pg lvi]</a></span>
evidences of the Icelandic occupation. Any serious efforts
to identify the Dighton inscription and the Newport Mill
with the age of the Northmen can only serve to injure a
good cause. If Professor Rafn could have seen these
memorials himself, he would doubtless have been among
the first to question the truth of the theory which he set
forth.</p>

<p>In regard to the structure at Newport, Professor Rafn
says that he is inclined to believe "that it had a sacred
destination, and that it belonged to some monastery or
Christian place of worship of one of the chief parishes in
Vinland. In Greenland," he says, "there are to be found
ruins of several round buildings in the vicinity of the
churches. One of this description, in diameter about
twenty-six feet, is situated at the distance of three hundred
feet to the eastward of the great church in Igalliko;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[Pg lvii]</a></span>
another of forty-four feet in diameter, at the distance of
four hundred and forty feet to the eastward of the church
in Karkortok; ... a third, of thirty-two feet diameter
amongst the ruins of sixteen buildings at Kanitsok."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
He supposes that all these ancient remains of the Icelanders,
which are to be seen in Greenland to-day, are
baptisteries, similar to those of Italy.</p>

<p>According to this view, there must have been a considerable
ecclesiastical establishment in Vinland, which is
not clearly indicated by the Sagas, from which we learn
no more than the simple fact that Bishop Eric sailed on a
voyage to this place in the year 1121. But is it probable
that the Northmen would have erected a baptistery like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span>
this, and, at the same time, left no other monument?
It seems hardly reasonable. Besides, whoever examines
this ancient structure must be impressed by its modern
aspect, so especially apparent in the preservation of the
mortar, which does not bear the marks of seven centuries.
The displacement of a portion of the masonry might perhaps
reveal some peculiarity that would effectually settle
the question of its antiquity to the satisfaction of all.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>In treating this subject we shall run into needless errors
and difficulties, if we attempt the task of discovering
monuments of the Northmen in New England. In Greenland
these evidences of their occupation are abundant,
because they were regularly established on the ground for
generations, and formed their public and private edifices
of the only material at hand, which was well nigh imperishable.
But their visits to New England were comparatively
few, and were scattered over many years.
Owing to the weakness of their numbers, they found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span>
permanent colonies impracticable. Thorfinn Karlsefne
deliberately gave up the attempt at the end of a three
years experiment, saying that it would be impossible to
maintain themselves against the more numerous bands of
natives. Their habitations were temporary. The various
companies that came into Vinland, instead of building
new houses, took possession of Leif's booths, and simply
added others like them when they afforded insufficient
quarters. To ask for monuments of the Northmen is
therefore unreasonable, since their wooden huts and timber
crosses must soon have disappeared. The only memorial
we have a right to expect is some trifling relic, a coin or
amulet, perhaps, that chance may yet throw in the antiquarian's
way.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> In the meanwhile among scholars the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</a></span>
Icelandic narratives are steadily winning their way to
unquestioned belief. This is all the more gratifying in
an age like the present, in which large portions of history
are being dismissed to the realms of hoary fable, and all
the annals of the past are being studied in a critical spirit,
with true aims and a pure zeal.</p>

<h3><a name="I_FRAGMENTS_FROM_LANDNAMA-BOK" id="I_FRAGMENTS_FROM_LANDNAMA-BOK"></a>I. FRAGMENTS FROM LANDNAMA-BOK.</h3>


<p>The following extracts from the <i>Landnama</i>,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> give us the
earliest information on record, in regard to the westward
movements of the Icelanders. The men referred to were
well known, and the mention of their names and exploits
in this great work, than which no higher authority could
be produced, is gratifying. These extracts, which are
given in the order in which they stand in vol. <span class="smcap">I.</span> of <i>Gr&ouml;nland's
Historiske Mindesm&aelig;rker</i>, the greater portion of which
work is the labor of Finn Magnusen, have probably never
appeared before in an English dress. The first extract
simply mentions Gunnbiorn and his Rocks; the second
shows that Eric the Red obtained his knowledge of the
existence of Greenland through this person; the third
again gives the name of Gunnbiorn: while the fourth
furnishes a brief account of an early voyage to the Rocks.
It appears from these references, that, previous to the sail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>ing
of Eric the Red, the existence of land at the west was
well understood, the report of Gunnbiorn's adventure having
been quite generally circulated amongst the people.</p>

<hr class="half" />

<p>1. There was a man named Grimkel, [A. D. 876.] son of
Ulf Hreidarson, called Krage, and brother to Gunnbiorn,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
after whom Gunnbiorn's Rocks<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> are named. He took possession
of that piece of land that extends from Berevigs
R&ouml;in to Ness R&ouml;in, and out round the point o&pound; the cape.
And he lived on Saxahval. He drove away Saxe, a son of
Alfarin Valeson, and he lived on the R&ouml;in of Saxahval.
Alfarin Valeson had first taken possession of the cape
between Berevigs R&ouml;in and Enne.</p>


<p class="npara">2. Eric Red [A. D. 983.] said that he intended to find
the land that was seen by Gunnbiorn,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Ulf Krage's son,
when he was driven by a storm west from Iceland, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
found Gunnbiorn's Rocks. [A. D. 876.] At the same time
he said if he did not find the land he would return to his
friends.</p>


<p class="npara">3. Two sons of Gunnbiorn, Ulf Krage's son, after whom
Gunnbiorn's Rocks were named, were called Gunstein
and Haldor. They took possession of Sk&ouml;tufiorden, L&ouml;igardelen
and Ogursvigen to Mjorfiord. Berse was Haldor's
son, father to Thormod Kalbrunarskald.</p>

<p>Sn&aelig;biorn (Holmstein's son), called Galte, owned a ship
[A. D. 970.] that lay in the mouth of Grimsar (in Borgafiorden).
Rolf, from R&ouml;desand, bought a half of the
ship. Each of the parties mustered twelve men. With
Sn&aelig;biorn, was Thorkel and Sumarlide, sons of Thorgier
Red, son of Einar, from Stafholdt.</p>

<p>Sn&aelig;biorn also took Thorod from Thingness, his step-father
and his five sons, and Rolf took St&aelig;rbiorn. The
last named recited the following verse, after he had a
dream:</p>

<p class="poem">

</p>

<p class="noidt">They sought Gunnbiorn's Rocks and found land. Sn&aelig;biorn
would not permit any one to go ashore in the night.
St&aelig;rbiorn landed, notwithstanding, and found a purse<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
with money in an earth hole, and concealed it. Sn&aelig;biorn
hit him with an axe so that the purse fell down.</p>

<p>They built a cabin to live in, and it was all covered with
snow. Thorkel Red's son, found that there was water on
a shelf that stood out of the cabin window. This was in
the month of Goe.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> They shovelled the snow away.
Sn&aelig;biorn rigged the ship; Thorod and five of his party
were in the hut, and St&aelig;rbiorn and several men of Rolf's
party. Some hunted.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> St&aelig;rbiorn killed Thorod, but both

were obliged to take the oath of allegiance to save their
lives. They arrived on their return at Helgeland, Norway,

<p>The first document relating to the settlement of Greenland
by the Northmen, is taken from the Saga of Eric the
Red, as given in Professor Rafn's <i>Antiquitates American&aelig;</i>.
Besides the history of Eric and his sons, that Saga contains
notices of other voyages. The following are simply
extracts. The whole Saga does not necessarily apply to
the subject under examination&mdash;the Discovery of America.
The second extract, which gives more of the particulars,
is from <i>Gr&ouml;nland's Historiske Mindesm&aelig;rker</i>, vol. <span class="smcap">ii</span>, p. 201.
The third is also taken from the same great historical
depository.</p>


<h4>FIRST NARRATIVE.</h4>

<p>There was a man named Thorvald, son of Osvald, son
of Ulf-Oexna-Thorerisson. Thorvald and his son were
obliged to leave Jardar<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and go to Iceland, on account of
manslaughter. At that time Iceland was generally colo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>nized.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
They first lived in Drangey, where Thorvald died.
Then Eric married Thorhild, daughter of Jorund and
Thorbiarg Knarrabringa, whom afterwards Thorbiorn of
Haukdale married. Eric moved from the north, and fixed
his abode in Ericstad opposite Vatshorn. The son of Eric
and Thorhold was named Leif. But after Eyulf Soers and
Holm-Gang Rafn's murder, Eric was banished from Haukdale.
Eric went westward to Breidafiord and lived at
Oexney in Ericstad. He lent Thorgest his seat-posts,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and
he could not get them again. He then demanded them.
Then came disputes and hostility between him and Thorgest,
which is told in the history of Eric. Styr Thorgrim's
son, Eyulf of Svinoe, the sons of Brand of Aptelfiord and
Thorbiorn Vifilsson plead the cause of Eric; Thorder
Gellurson and Thorgeir of Hitardale plead for Thorgest.
Eric was declared outlawed by the Thing, and prepared his
ship for sea in Eric's Bay. Styr and the others went with
him beyond the island. [A. D. 982.] Then Eric declared
it to be his resolution to seek the land which Gunnbiorn,
Ulf Krage's son, saw [A. D. 876.] when driven into the
Western ocean, where he found Gunnbiorn's Rocks, saying,
that if he did not find the land he would return to his
friends. Eric set sail from Sn&aelig;fellsjokul, and found land
which from its height he called Midjokul, now called Blaaserk.
Thence he sailed along the shore in a southerly
direction, seeking for the nearest habitable land. The first
winter he passed in Ericseya,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> near the middle of the east district.
The following year he came into Ericsfiord, where he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
fixed his seat. The same summer he explored the western
desert, and gave names to many places. The following
winter he passed on a holm opposite Rafnsgnipa,
and the third year he came into Iceland and brought
his ship into Breidafiord. The land which he found, he
named Greenland, saying that men would be persuaded to
go to a land with so good a name. Eric stayed in Iceland
that winter, and the summer after he went over to the
land which he had found, and fixed his abode in Brattahlid
in Ericsfiord. [A. D. 986.] Men acquainted with affairs,
say, that this same summer in which Eric went to settle in
Greenland, thirty-five ships sailed from Breidafiord and
Bogafjord, of which only fourteen arrived, and the rest
were driven back or lost. This event took place fifteen winters<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
before the Christian religion was established in Iceland.
The same summer, Bishop Frederick and Thorvold Kodranson
went from Iceland.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Among those who emigrated
with Eric and established themselves, were Heriulf Heriulfsfiord
who took Heriulfsness, and abode in Heriulfsness,
Ketil Ketilsfiord, Rafn Rafnsfiord, Solvi Solvidale,
Helgi Thorbrandson Alptafiord, Thorbjornglora Siglefjord,
Einar Einarsfiord, Hafgrim Hafgrimsfiord and Vatnahver,
Arnlaug Arnlaugsfiord; and other men went to the west
district.</p>


<h4><i>The Baptism of Leif the Fortunate.</i></h4>

<p>And when the sixth<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> winter had passed [A. D. 999.]
since Eric Red went to live in Greenland, Leif, son of Eric,
went over from Greenland to Norway, and in the autumn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
arrived in Throndheim and came north to King Olaf Trygvesson,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
from Hegeland. He brought his ship to Nidaros
and went at once to King Olaf. The king commanded Leif
and some other pagan men to come to him. They were
exhorted to accept religion, which the king having easily
arranged with Leif, he and all his sailors were baptized,
and passed the winter with the king, being liberally entertained.</p>


<h4>SECOND NARRATIVE.</h4>

<p>Thorvold the son of Usvold, son of Ulf, son of Oexne-Thorer,
and his son, Eric Red, left Jardar in Norway on
account of manslaughter, and took possession of a piece of
land on Hornastrand [Iceland], and lived there at Drangey.
There Thorvold died. Eric then married Thorhild,
daughter of Jorund Atleson and Thorbiarg Knarrabringa,
who was then married to Thorbiorn of Haukdale. Then
Eric went from the north and ploughed the fields in Haukdale.
Then he lived in Ericstadt by Vatshorn. There his
thralls<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> let a piece of rock tumble down over Valthiof's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
house in Valthiofstadt. But his relation, Eyulf S&ouml;irs, killed
the thralls at Kneide-Brinke above Vatshorn. For this
cause, Eric killed Eyulf S&ouml;irs. He also killed Holm-Gang
Rafn at Leikskaale. Geirstein and Odd at J&ouml;rund Eyulf
S&ouml;irs relations brought a suit against the slayer. Eric was
then banished from Hauksdale, and took possession of the
islands, Brok&ouml; and Oexno, but lived in Todum at Sydero,
the first winter. Then he loaned Thorgest his seat-posts.
Then Eric moved to Oexno and lived in Ericstadt. Then
he demanded his seat-posts, but did not get them. Eric
took them thereafter from Bredobolstad, but Thorgest
followed him. They fought near the house at Drangey.
Two sons of Thorgest fell, and some other men. Thereafter
they both kept their followers with them. Styr,
Eyulf of Svino, Thorbrand's sons of Alptefiord, and Thorbiorn
Vifilsson, were of Eric's party. But Thord Gelleirson,
Thorgeir from Hitardale, Aslak of Langedale, and Illuge's
son helped Thorgest. Eric and his party were sentenced
to be banished at Thorsness Thing. He fitted out a ship
in Ericsfiord, but Eyulf concealed him in Dimonsvaag,
while Thorgest and his men sought after him on the
highlands. Thorbiorn, Eyulf and Styr followed with Eric
out to sea beyond the islands. He said that he meant to
seek the land Gunnbiorn, Ulf Krage's son, saw [A. D. 876.]
when he was driven by a storm west from Iceland, and
found Gunnbiorn's Rocks; though he said at the same time
if he discovered the land he would return to his friends.
[A. D. 982.] Eric laid his course to the west from Sn&aelig;fieldness,
and approached [Greenland] from the sea to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
land at Midjokul, in that place that is called Bl&aelig;sark.
From thence he went along the coast to the south, to see if
the land was fit to live in. The first year he stayed all
winter in Ericks&ouml;, nearly in the middle of the west bygd.
In the next spring [A. D. 983.] he went to Ericsfiord, and
there found a dwelling. Next summer he went to the
western bygd, and gave certain names to many places.
The second winter he lived in Ericsholm, at Hvarfo Fiedspid&aelig;,
and at the third summer [A. D. 984.] he went north
to Sn&aelig;field, inside of Rafnsfiord. He thought then that
the place where Ericsfiord bent was opposite the place
where he came. He then returned and spent the third
winter in Ericks&ouml; opposite the mouth of Ericsfiord. The
next summer [A. D. 985.] he went to Iceland, and landed
at Breidafiord. The next winter he stayed at Holmstater,
with Ingolf. Next spring he fought with Thorgest and
lost the battle. That summer, Eric began to settle the
land which he had discovered [A. D. 986.] and which he
called Greenland, because he said that the people would
not like to move there, if the land did not have a good
name. Learned men say that twenty-five ships went that
summer to Greenland from Breidafiord and Borgafjord,
but only fourteen arrived. Of the rest, some were driven
back and others were wrecked. This happened fifteen
winters before Christianity was introduced into Iceland.</p>


<h4>THIRD NARRATIVE.</h4>

<p>The land some call Greenland, was discovered and
settled from Iceland. Eric the Red was the name of the
Breidafiord man, who [A. D. 986.] went from here [Iceland]
to there, and took possession of that part of the land, which
later was called Ericsfiord. He named the land and called
it Greenland, and said it would encourage people to come
there, if the land had a good name. They found there,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
both east and west, ruins of houses and pieces of boats,
and begun stonework. From which it is to be seen what
kind of people have lived in Vinland, and which the Greenlanders
call Skr&aelig;lings and who had been there. He [Eric]
began to settle the land fourteen or fifteen years before the
introduction of Christianity in Iceland. Afterwards this
was told of Greenland to Thorkel Gelleirson, by a man
who had himself followed Eric Red.</p>

<h3><a name="III_THE_VOYAGE_OF_BIARNE" id="III_THE_VOYAGE_OF_BIARNE"></a>III. THE VOYAGE OF BIARNE.</h3>


<p>The voyage of Biarne to Greenland was attended by
many hardships. His vessel was blown away from the
course during a storm, at which time he saw the shores of
the American continent, yet he made no attempt to land.
Of this voyage we have two versions. The first is a
translation of a passage from <i>Codex Flat&ouml;iensis</i>, given in
<i>Antiquitates America&aelig;</i>, p. 17. The second is taken from
<i>Gr&ouml;nland's Historiske Mindesm&aelig;rker</i>. The date of this
voyage is fixed by the fact that Biarne sailed the same
season that his father settled in Greenland, which, as
we learn from the narrative of Eric, was in the year
985. There is a complete agreement between this account
and the preceding.</p>


<h4>FIRST NARRATIVE.</h4>

<p>Heriulf was the son of Bard, Heriulf's son, who was a
relation of Ingolf the Landnamsman.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Ingolf gave Heriulf
land between Vog and Reikianess. Heriulf dwelt first at
Dropstock. His wife was called Thorgird, and their son<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
was called Biarne. He was a promising young man. In
his earliest youth he had a desire to go abroad, and he
soon gathered property and reputation; and was by turns
a year abroad, and a year with his father. Biarne was
soon in possession of a merchant ship of his own. The
last winter [A. D. 985.] while he was in Norway, Heriulf
prepared to go to Greenland with Eric, and gave up his
dwelling. There was a Christian man belonging to the
Hebudes along with Heriulf, who composed the lay called
the <i>Hafgerdingar</i><a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Song, in which is this stave:</p>

<p class="poem">
May he whose hand protects so well<br />
The simple monk in lonely cell,<br />
And o'er the world upholds the sky,<br />
His own blue hall, still stand me by.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Heriulf settled at Heriulfness [A. D. 985.] and became a
very distinguished man. Eric Red took up his abode at
Bratthalid, and was in great consideration, and honored by
all. These were Eric's children: Leif, Thorvold, and Thorstein;
and his daughter was called Ferydis. She was married
to a man called Thorvald; and they dwelt at Gardar, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
is now a bishop's seat. She was a haughty, proud woman;
and he was but a mean man. She was much given to
gathering wealth. The people of Greenland were heathen
at this time. Biarne came over the same summer [A. D.
985.] with his ship to the strand<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> which his father had
sailed abroad from in the spring. He was much struck with
the news, and would not unload his vessel. When his
crew asked him what he intended to do, he replied that
he was resolved to follow his old custom by taking up his
winter abode with his father. "So I will steer for Greenland
if ye will go with me." They one and all agreed to
go with him. Biarne said, "Our voyage will be thought
foolish, as none of us have been on the Greenland sea
before." Nevertheless they set out to sea as soon as they
were ready, and sailed for three days, until they lost sight
of the land they left. But when the wind failed, a north
wind with fog set in, and they knew not where they were
sailing to; and this lasted many days. At last they saw the
sun, and could distinguish the quarters of the sky; so they
hoisted sail again, and sailed a whole day and night, when
they made land. They spoke among themselves what
this land could be, and Biarne said that, in his opinion, it
could not be Greenland. On the question, if he should
sail nearer to it, he said, "It is my advice that we sail up
close to the land." They did so; and they soon saw that
the land was without mountains, was covered with woods,
and that there were small hills inland. They left the land
on the larboard side, and had their sheet on the land side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Then they sailed two days and nights before they got sight
of land again. They asked Biarne if they thought this
would be Greenland; but he gave his opinion that the land
was no more Greenland, than the land they had seen
before. "For on Greenland, it is said, there are great
snow mountains." They soon came near to the land, and
saw that it was flat and covered with trees. Now, as the
wind fell, the ship's people talked of its being advisable to
make for the land; but Biarne would not agree to it.
They thought that they would need wood and water; but
Biarne said: "Ye are not in want of either." And the
men blamed him for this. He ordered them to hoist
the sail, which was done. They now turned the ship's
bow from the land, and kept the sea for three days and
nights, with a fine breeze from southwest. Then they saw
a third land, which was high and mountainous, and with
snowy mountains. Then they asked Biarne if he would
land here; but he refused altogether: "For in my opinion
this land is not what we want."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Now they let the sails
stand and kept along the land and saw it was an island.
Then they turned from the land and stood out to sea with
the same breeze; but the gale increased, and Biarne
ordered a reef to be taken in, and not to sail harder than
the ship and her tackle could easily bear. After sailing
three days and nights, they made, the fourth time, land;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and when they asked Biarne if he thought this was Greenland
or not, Biarne replies: "This is most like what has
been told me of Greenland; and here we shall take to the
land." They did so, and came to the land in the evening,
under a ness, where they found a boat. On this ness
dwelt Biarne's father, Heriulf; and from that it is called
Heriulfness. Biarne went to his father's, gave up sea-faring,
and after his father's death, continued to dwell
there when at home.</p>


<h4>SECOND NARRATIVE.</h4>

<p>A man named Heriulf, son of Bard, son of Heriulf, a
relation to Landnamsman Ingolf, who gave the last named
Heriulf the piece of land that lies between Vaag and Reikianess.
The younger Heriulf went to Greenland, when
Eric Red began to settle there, and on his ship was a
Christian man from the South Islands [the Hebrides] who
was the author of the poem, <i>Havgerdingar</i>, in which was the
following verse:</p>

<p class="poem">
I to the monk's protector pray<br />
That he will give my voyage luck!<br />
The heaven's great Ruler<br />
Save me from danger.<br />
</p>

<p>Heriulf took possession of Heriulfsfiord, and became one
of the chief men. Eric Red took to himself Ericsfiord,
and lived in Brattahlid, and Leif, his son, after his death.
Those men who at the same time went away with Eric
took possession of the following pieces of land: Heriulf
Heriulfsfiord, and he lived in Heriulfness, Ketil Ketilsfiord,
Rafn Rafnsfiord, S&ouml;lve S&ouml;lvedale, Snorro Thorbrandson
Alptefiord, Thorbiornglora Siglefiord, Einar Einarsfiord,
Havgrim Havgrimsfiord and Vatnahverf, Arnlaug Arnlaugfiord;
but some went to the west bygd. A man named<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Thorkel Forsark, cousin to Eric Red on their mother's
side, went to Greenland with Eric, and took possession of
Hvals&ouml;fiord, together with the greater part of the piece of
land between Eyolfsfiord and Einarsfiord, and lived in
Hvalos&ouml;fne. From him came the Hvals&ouml;fiord people.
He was very strong. Once Eric Red visited him, and he
would welcome his guest in the best way possible, but he
had no boats at hand which he could use. He was compelled
to swim out to Hvals&ouml;, and get a full-grown sheep,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
and carry it on his back home to his house. It was a
good half mile. Thorkel was buried in a cave in the field
of Hvals&ouml;fiord.</p>

<h3><a name="IV_LEIFS_VOYAGE_TO_VINLAND" id="IV_LEIFS_VOYAGE_TO_VINLAND"></a>IV. LEIF'S VOYAGE TO VINLAND.</h3>


<p>This voyage is recorded in the <i>Flat&ouml; Manuscript</i>, and is
given in <i>Antiquitates American&aelig;</i>, pp. 26-40. It contains the
account of the voyage of Leif, son of Eric the Red, who,
following out the hints of Biarne, sailed to discover the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
new land, which he called Vinland, on account of the
quantity of vines that he found growing wild. Several
extracts are appended, because of interest in connection
with the subject.</p>

<hr class="half" />

<p>[A. D. 984.] It is next to be told that Biarne Heriulfson
came over from Greenland to Norway, on a visit to Earl
Eric, who received him well. Biarne tells of this expedition
of his, in which he had discovered unknown land; and
people thought he had not been very curious to get knowledge,
as he could not give any account of those countries,
and he was somewhat blamed on this account. [A. D. 986.]
Biarne was made a Court man of the earl, and the summer
after he went over to Greenland; and afterwards there
was much talk about discovering unknown lands. Leif, a
son of Eric Red of Brattahlid, went over<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> to Biarne Heriulfson,
and bought the ship from him, and manned the
vessel, so that in all, there were thirty-five men on board.
Leif begged his father Eric to go as commander of the
expedition; but he excused himself, saying he was getting
old, and not so able as formerly to undergo the hardship
of a sea voyage. Leif insisted that he among all their
relations was the most likely to have good luck on such an
expedition; and Eric consented, and rode from home with
Leif, when they had got all ready for sea; but when they
were coming near to the ship,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> the horse on which Eric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
was riding, stumbled, and he fell from his horse<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and hurt
his foot. "It is destined," said Eric, "that I should never
discover more lands than this of Greenland, on which we
live; and now we must not run hastily into this adventure."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
Eric accordingly returned home to Brattahlid, but
Leif, with his comrades, in all thirty-five men, rigged out
their vessel. There was a man from the south country
called Tyrker,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> with the expedition. [A. D. 1000.] They
put the ship in order, and put to sea when they were ready.
They first came to the land which Biarne had last discovered,
sailed up to it, cast anchor, put out a boat and
went on shore; but there was no grass to be seen. There
were large snowy mountains<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> up the country; but all the
way from the sea up to these snowy ridges, the land was
one field of snow, and it appeared to them a country of no
advantages. Leif said: "It shall not be said of us, as it
was of Biarne, that we did not come upon the land; for I
will give the country a name, and call it Helluland."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
Then they went on board again and put to sea, and found
another land. They sailed in towards it, put out a boat,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
and landed. The country was flat,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and overgrown with
wood; and the strand far around, consisted of a white
sand, and low towards the sea. Then Leif said: "We
shall give this land a name according to its kind, and
called it Markland."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Then they hastened on board, and
put to sea again with the wind from the northeast, and were
out for two days and made land. They sailed towards it,
and came to an island<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> which lay on the north side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
of the land, where they disembarked<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> to wait for good
weather. There was dew upon the grass; and having
accidentally gotten some of the dew upon their hands and
put it in their mouths, they thought that they had never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
tasted anything so sweet as it was.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Then they went on
board and sailed into a sound<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> that was between the island
and a ness<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> that went out northwards from the land, and
sailed westward<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> past the ness. There was very shallow<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
water in ebb tide, so that their ship lay dry; and there was
a long way between their ship and the water. They were
so desirous to get to the land that they would not wait till
their ship floated, but ran to the land, to a place where a
river comes out of a lake. As soon as their ship was
afloat they took the boats, rowed to the ship, towed her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
up the river,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and from thence into the lake,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> where they
cast anchor, carried their beds out of the ship, and set up
their tents. They resolved to put things in order for
wintering there, and they erected a large house. They did
not want for salmon,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> both in the river and in the lake; and
they thought the salmon larger than any they had ever
seen before. The country appeared to them of so good a
kind, that it would not be necessary to gather fodder for
the cattle for winter.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> There was no frost in winter,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and
the grass was not much withered. Day and night were
more equal than in Greenland and Iceland; for on the
shortest day the sun was in the sky between Eyktarstad<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and the Dagmalastad. Now when they were ready with
their house building, [A. D. 1001.] Leif said to his fellow
travellers: "Now I will divide the crew into two divisions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
and explore the country. Half shall stay at home and do
the work, and the other half shall search the land; but so
that they do not go farther than they can come back in the
evening, and that they do not wander from each other."
This they continued to do for some time. Leif changed
about, sometimes with them, and sometimes with those at
home. Leif was a stout and strong man, and of manly
appearance; and was, besides, a prudent and sagacious
man in all respects.</p>

<p>It happened one evening that a man of the party was
missing; and it was the south country man, Tyrker. Leif
was very sorry for this, because Tyrker had long been in
his father's house, and he loved Tyrker in his childhood.
Leif blamed his comrades very much, and proposed to
go with twelve men on an expedition to find him; but
they had gone only a short way from the station when
Tyrker came to meet them, and he was joyfully received.
Leif soon perceived that his foster father<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> was quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
merry.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Tyrker had a high forehead, sharp eyes, with a
small face, and was little in size, and ugly; but was very
dexterous in all feats. Leif said to him, "Why art thou so
late, my foster-father? and why didst thou leave thy comrades?"
He spoke at first long in German, rolled his eyes
and knit his brows; but they could not make out what he
was saying. After a while, and some delay, he said in
Norse, "I did not go much farther than they; and yet I
have something altogether new to relate, for I found vines
and grapes."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> "Is that true, my foster-father?" said Leif.
"Yes, true it is," answered he, "for I was born where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
there was no scarcity of grapes." Now they slept all night,
and the next morning Leif said to his men, "Now we
shall have two occupations to attend to, and day about;
namely, to gather grapes or cut vines, and to fell wood in
the forest to lade our vessel." And this advice was followed.
It is related that their stern boat was filled with
grapes, and then a cargo of wood was hewn for the vessel.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
Towards spring they made ready and sailed sway, and Leif
gave the country a name from its products, and called it
Vinland.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> They now sailed into the open sea and had a
fair wind until they came in sight of Greenland and the
lands below the ice mountains.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Then a man put in a
word and said to Leif, "Why do you steer so close on
the wind?" Leif replied: "I mind my helm and tend to
other things too; do you notice anything?" They said
that they saw nothing remarkable. "I do not know,"
said Leif, "whether I see a ship or a rock." Then they
looked and saw that it was a rock. But he saw so much
better than they, that he discovered men upon the rock.
"Now I will," said Leif, "that we hold to the wind, that
we may come up to them if they should need help; and if
they should not be friendly inclined, it is in our power to
do as we please and not theirs." Now they sailed under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the rock, lowered their sails, cast anchor, and put out
another small boat which they had with them. Then
Tyrker asked who their leader was. He said his name
was Thorer, and said he was a Northman;<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> "But what is
your name?" said he. Leif told his name. "Are you the
son of Eric the Red of Brattahlid?" he asked. Leif said
that was so. "Now I will," said Leif, "take ye and all
on board my ship, and as much of the goods as the ship
will store." They took up this offer, and sailed away to
Ericfiord with the cargo, and from thence to Brattahlid,
where they unloaded the ship. Leif offered Thorer and
his wife, Gudrid, and three others, lodging with himself,
and offered lodging elsewhere for the rest of the people,
both of Thorer's crew and his own. Leif took fifteen men
from the rock, and thereafter was called, Leif the Lucky.
After that time Leif advanced greatly in wealth and consideration.
That winter, sickness came among Thorer's
people, and he himself, and a great part of his crew, died.
The same winter Eric Red died. This expedition to
Vinland was much talked of, and Leif's brother, Thorvald,
thought that the country had not been explored enough in
different places. Then Leif said to Thorvald, "You may
go, brother, in my ship to Vinland if you like; but I will
first send the ship for the timber which Thorer left upon
the rock." And so it was done.</p>

<h4>SECOND NARRATIVE.</h4>

<p>The same spring, King Olaf, as said before, sent Gissur<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
and Hialte<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> to Iceland. The king also sent Leif to
Greenland to proclaim Christianity there. The king sent
with him, a priest, and some other religious men, to baptize
the people and teach them the true faith. Leif sailed
the same summer to Greenland; he took up out of the
ocean, the people of a ship who were on a wreck completely
destroyed, and in a perishing condition. And on this
same voyage he discovered Vinland the Good,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and came
at the close of summer to Brattahlid, to his father Eric.
After that time the people called him, Leif the Fortunate;
but his father Eric said that these two things went against
one another; that Leif had saved the crew of the ship, and
delivered them from death, and that he had [brought] that
bad man into Greenland, that is what he called the priest;
but after much urging, Eric was baptized,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> as well as all
the people of Greenland.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<h4>THIRD NARRATIVE.</h4>

<p>The same winter, Leif, the son of Eric the Red, was in
high favor with King Olaf, and embraced Christianity.
But the summer that Gissur went to Iceland, King Olaf
sent Leif to Greenland, to proclaim Christianity. He sailed
the same summer for Greenland. He found some men in
the sea on a wreck, and helped them; the same voyage,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
he discovered Vinland the Good, and came at harvest time
to Greenland. He brought with him a priest and other
religious<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> men, and went to live at Brattahlid with his
father Eric. He was afterwards called, Leif the Fortunate.
But his father Eric said, that these two things were
opposed to one another, because Leif had saved the crew
of the ship, and brought evil men to Greenland, meaning
the priests.</p>

<h3><a name="V_THORVALD_ERICSONS_EXPEDITION" id="V_THORVALD_ERICSONS_EXPEDITION"></a>V. THORVALD ERICSON'S EXPEDITION.</h3>


<p>The greater portion of this voyage appears to have been
performed during two summers, the expedition finally
returning to Greenland on account of the death of their
leader. The narrative is taken from <i>Codex Flat&ouml;iensis</i>, as
given in <i>Antiquitates American&aelig;</i>.</p>

<hr class="half" />
<p>Now Thorvald [A. D. 1002.] made ready for his voyage
with thirty men, after consulting his brother Leif. They
rigged their ship, and put to sea. Nothing is related of
this expedition until they came to Vinland, to the booths
put up by Leif, where they secured the ship and tackle,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>and remained quietly all winter and lived by fishing. In
spring [A. D. 1003.] Thorvald ordered the vessel to be
rigged, and that some men should proceed in the long-boat
westward along the coast, and explore it during the
summer. They thought the country beautiful and well
wooded, the distance small between the forest and the sea,
and the strand full of white sand. There were also many
islands and very shallow water. They found no abode
for man or beast, but on an island far towards the west,
they found a corn barn constructed of wood. They found
no other traces of human work, and came back in autumn
to Leif's booths. The following spring, [A. D. 1004.]
Thorvald, with his merchant ship, proceeded eastwards, and
towards the north along the land.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Opposite to a cape<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
they met bad weather, and drove upon the land and broke
their keel, and remained there a long time to repair the
vessel. Thorvald said to his companions: "We will stick
up the keel here upon the ness, and call the place
Kialarness," which they did. Then they sailed away eastward
along the country, to a point of land,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> which was
everywhere covered with woods. They moored the vessel
to the land, laid out gangways to the shore, and Thorvald
with all his ship's company, landed. He said, "Here it is
beautiful, and I would willingly set up my abode here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
They afterwards went on board, and saw three specks upon
the sand within the point, and went to them and found
there were three skin boats with three men under each
boat. They divided their men and took all of them
prisoners, except one man, who escaped with his boat.
They killed eight of them, and then went to the point and
looked about them. Within this bay they saw several
eminences, which they took to be habitations. Then a
great drowsiness came upon them and they could not keep
themselves awake, but all of them fell asleep. A sudden
scream came to them, and they all awoke; and mixed with
the scream they thought they heard the words: "Awake,
Thorvald, with all thy comrades, if ye will save your lives.
Go on board your ship as fast as you can, and leave this
land without delay." In the same moment an innumerable
multitude, from the interior of the bay, came in skin
boats and laid themselves alongside. Then said Thorvald,
"We shall put up our war screens<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> along the gunwales
and defend ourselves as well as we can, but not use our
weapons much against them." They did so accordingly.
The Skr&aelig;llings<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> shot at them for a while, and then fled
away as fast as they could. Then Thorvald asked if anyone
was wounded, and they said nobody was hurt. He
said: "I have a wound under the arm.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> An arrow flew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
between the gunwale and the shield under my arm: here
is the arrow, and it will be my death wound. Now I
advise you to make ready with all speed to return; but ye
shall carry me to the point which I thought would be so
convenient for a dwelling. It may be that it was true
what I said, that here would I dwell for a while. Ye shall
bury me there, and place a cross at my head and one at my
feet, and call the place Crossness." Christianity had been
established in Greenland at this time;<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> but Eric Red was
dead<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> before Christianity was introduced. Now Thorvald
died, and they did everything as he had ordered. Then
they went away in search of their fellow voyagers; and
they related to each other all the news. They remained
in their dwelling all winter, and gathered vines and grapes,
and put them on board their ships. Towards spring, they
prepared to return to Greenland, where they arrived with
their vessel, and landed at Ericsfiord, bringing heavy tidings
to Leif.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="VI_THORSTEIN_ERICSONS_ATTEMPT_TO_FIND" id="VI_THORSTEIN_ERICSONS_ATTEMPT_TO_FIND"></a>VI. THORSTEIN ERICSON'S ATTEMPT TO FIND VINLAND.</h3>



<p>This version is from <i>Codex Flat&ouml;iensis</i>, and is given in
<i>Antiquitates American&aelig;</i>, pp. 47-55. The expedition was
wholly unsuccessful, and the leader finally died without
reaching the desired land. One cannot help feeling, notwithstanding
the marvellous events recorded, that the basis
of this account, is formed of solid fact. The main narrative
is not one likely to have been invented by an impostor.</p>

<hr class="half" />


<p>In the meantime it had happened in Greenland, that
Thorstein of Ericsfiord had married, and taken to wife,
[A. D. 1005.] Gudrid, the daughter of Thorbiorn, who
had been married, as before related, to Thorer, the Eastman.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
Thorstein Ericsson bethought him now, that he
would go to Vinland, for his brother Thorvald's body.
He rigged out the same vessel, and chose an able and
stout crew. He had with him, twenty-five men, and his
wife Gudrid; and as soon as they were ready he put to
sea, and they quickly lost sight of the land. They drove
about on the ocean the whole summer, without knowing
where they were; and in the first week of winter,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> they
landed at Lysifiord in Greenland, in the western settlement.
Thorstein looked for lodgings for his men, and got
his whole ship's crew accommodated, but not himself and
wife; so that for some nights they had to sleep on board.
At that time Christianity was but recent in Greenland.
One day, early in the morning, some men came to their
tent, and the leader asked them what people were in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
tent? Thorstein replies, "Two; who is it that asks?"
"Thorstein," was the reply, "and I am called Thorstein
the Black, and it is my errand here, to offer thee and
thy wife lodging beside me." Thorstein said he would
speak to his wife about it; and as she gave her consent,
he agreed to it. "Then I shall come for you to-morrow
with my horses,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> for I do not want means to entertain you;
but few care to live in my house, for I and my wife live
lonely, and I am very melancholy. I have also a different
religion<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> from yours, although I think the one you have,
the best." Now the following morning he came for them
with horses; and they took up their abode with Thorstein
Black, who was very friendly towards them. Gudrid had
a good outward appearance, and was knowing, and understood
well how to behave with strangers. Early in the
winter, a sickness prevailed among Thorstein Ericsson's
people, and many of his ship men died. He ordered that
coffins should be made for the bodies of the dead, and that
they should be brought on board, and stowed away carefully;
for he said, "I will transport all the bodies to Ericsfiord
in summer." It was not long before sickness broke
out in Thorstein Black's house, and his wife, who was
called Grimhild, fell sick first. She was very stout, and
as strong as a man, but yet she could not bear up against
the illness. Soon after, Thorstein Ericksson also fell sick,
and they both lay ill in bed at the same time; but Grimhild,
Thorstein Black's wife died first. When she was
dead, Thorstein went out of the room for a skin to lay
over the corpse. Then Gudrid said, "My dear Thorstein,
be not long away;" which he promised. Then said
Thorstein Ericsson, "Our housewife is wonderful, for she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
raises herself up with her elbows, moves herself forward
over the bed-frame, and is feeling for her shoes." In the
same moment, Thorstein the Goodman, came back, and
instantly, Grimhild laid herself down, so that it made
every beam that was in the house, crack. Thorstein now
made a coffin for Grimhild's corpse, removed it outside,
and buried it. He was a stout and strong man, but it
required all his strength to remove the corpse from the
house. Now Thorstein Ericsson's illness increased upon
him, and he died, which Gudrid his wife took with great
grief. They were all in the room, and Gudrid had set
herself upon a stool before the bench on which her husband
Thorstein's body lay. Now Thorstein the goodman
took Gudrid from the stool in his arms, and set himself
with her upon a bench just opposite to Thorstein's body,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
and spoke much with her. He consoled her, and promised
to go with her in summer to Ericsfiord, with her husband
Thorstein's corpse, and those of his crew. "And," said
he, "I shall take with me many servants to console and
assist." She thanked him for this. Thorstein Ericsson
then raised himself up and said, "Where is Gudrid?"
And thrice he said this; but she was silent. Then she
said to Thorstein the Goodman, "Shall I give answer or
not?" He told her not to answer. Then went Thorstein
the Goodman across the room, and sat down in a chair,
and Gudrid set herself on his knee; and Thorstein the
Goodman said: "What wilt thou make known?" After
a while the corpse replies, "I wish to tell Gudrid her fate
beforehand, that she may be the better able to bear my
death; for I have come to a blessed resting place. And this
I have now to tell thee, Gudrid, that thou wilt be married<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
to an Iceland man, and ye will live long together; and
from you will descend many men, brave, gallant and wise,
and a well pleasing race of posterity. Ye shall go from
Greenland to Norway, and from thence to Iceland, where
ye shall dwell. And long will ye live together, but thou
wilt survive him; and then thou shalt go abroad, and go
southwards, and shall return to thy home in Iceland. And
there must a church be built, and thou must remain there
and be consecrated a nun, and there end thy days."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
then Thorstein sank backwards, and his corpse was put in
order and carried to the ship. Thorstein the Goodman
did all that he had promised. He sold in spring [A. D.
1006.] his land and cattle, and went with Gudrid and all
her goods; made ready the ship, got men for it, and then
went to Ericsfiord. The body was buried at the church.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
Gudrid went to Leif's at Brattahlid, and Thorstein the
Black took his abode in Ericsfiord, and dwelt there as
long as he lived; and was reckoned an able man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="VII_THORFINN_KARLSEFNES_EXPEDITION_TO" id="VII_THORFINN_KARLSEFNES_EXPEDITION_TO"></a>VII. THORFINN KARLSEFNE'S EXPEDITION TO VINLAND.</h3>



<p>This was in many respects the most important expedition
to New England, both as regards the numbers
engaged, and the information and experience derived.
We have three different accounts of this expedition. The
first is from the somewhat lengthy Saga of Thorfinn
Karlsefne, from the <i>Arn&aelig;-Magn&aelig;an Collection</i>; the second
is from the Saga of Eric the Red, being called "The
Account of Thorfinn:" while the third is a briefer
relation from <i>Codex Flat&ouml;iensis</i>. The two first may be
found in Rafn's <i>Antiquitates American&aelig;</i>, pp. 75-200; while
the last is also given in the same work, on pp. 55-64.</p>

<p>The Saga of Karlsefne is occupied largely at the beginning
with accounts of various matters connected with
social life; yet, as such subjects are not essential to the
treatment of the subject, they are all omitted, except the
account of Thorfinn's marriage with the widow of Thorstein
Ericson.</p>

<p>The notes to the narrative of Leif's expedition, which
precedes this in the chronological order, supersede the
necessity of treating a number of important points suggested
again in the present narrative.</p>

<p>It is believed that the principal manuscript of Thorstein
Karlsefne is a genuine autograph by one of his descendants,
the celebrated Hauk Erlander, the Governor or Lagman of
Iceland, in 1295, who was also one of the compilers of the
<i>Landnama-bok</i>. Erlander was the ninth in descent from
Thorfinn. Torf&aelig;us, who supposed that this manuscript
was lost, knew it only through corrupt extracts in the collection
of Bi&ouml;rn Johnson.</p>

<p>There will be found a substantial agreement between
the different accounts, notwithstanding they are not the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
work of eye witnesses. The differences are evidently such
as would not appear in the case of three writers who had
banded together for the purpose of carrying out a historical
fraud. The Saga of Thorfinn was written in Iceland, while
that of Eric was composed in Greenland. The account
from the <i>Flat&ouml; Manuscript</i>, was, of course, written in the
island which bears that name, and is extremely brief,
wanting many essential particulars.</p>


<h4>NARRATIVE OF THORFINN KARLSEFNE.</h4>

<p>There was a man named Thord, who dwelt at H&ouml;fda,
in H&ouml;fda-Strand. He married Fridgerda, daughter of
Thorer the Idle, and of Fridgerda the daughter of Kiarval,
King of the Irish. Thord was the son of Biarne
Byrdusmj&ouml;r,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> son of Thorvald, son of Aslak, son of Biarne
Ironsides, son of Ragnar Lodbrok. They had a son
named Snorre, who married Thorhild the Partridge, daughter
of Thord Geller. They had a son named Thord Horsehead.
Thorfinn Karlsefne was his son, whose mother's
name was Thoruna. Thorfinn occupied his time in merchant
voyages, and was thought a good trader. One
summer he fitted out his ship for a voyage to Greenland,
attended by Snorre Thorbrandson of Alptafiord, and a crew
of forty men. There was a man named Biarne Grimolfson
of Breidafiord, and another named Thorhall Gamlason of
Austfiord. The men fitted out a ship at the same time, to
voyage to Greenland. They also had a crew of forty men.
This ship, and that of Thorfinn, as soon as they were
ready, put to sea. It is not said how long they were on
the voyage; it is only told that both ships arrived at
Erics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>fiord in the autumn of that year. Leif<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and other people
rode down to the ships, and friendly exchanges were made.
The captains requested Leif to take whatever he desired of
their goods. Leif in return, entertained them well, and
invited the principal men of both ships to spend the
winter with him at Brattahlid. The merchants accepted
his invitation with thanks. Afterwards their goods were
moved to Brattahlid, where they had every entertainment
that they could desire; therefore their winter quarters
pleased them much. When the Yule feast began, Leif
was silent and more depressed than usual. Then Karlsefne
said to Leif: "Are you sick friend Leif? you do not
seem to be in your usual spirits. You have entertained
us most liberally, for which we desire to render you all
the service in our power. Tell me what it is that ails
you." "You have received what I have been able to
offer you," said Leif, "in the kindest manner and there is
no idea in my mind that you have been wanting in
courtesy; but I am afraid lest when you go away, it may be
said that you never saw a Yule<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> feast so meanly celebrated
as that which draws near, at which you will be entertained
by Leif of Brattahlid." "What shall never be the case,
friend," said Karlsefne, "we have ample stores in the ship;
take of these what you wish, and make a feast as splendid
as you please." Leif accepted this offer, and the Yule<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
began; and so well were Leif's plans made, that all were
surprised that such a rich feast could be prepared in so
poor a country. After the Yule feast, Karlsefne began to
treat with Leif, as to the marriage of Gudrid,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Leif being
the person to whom the right of betrothal belonged. Lief
gave a favorable reply, and said she must fulfill that
destiny which fate had assigned, and that he had heard
of none except a good report of him; and in the end it
turned out that Karlsefne married Gudrid, and their wedding
was held at Brattahlid, this same winter.</p>


<p class="npara">[A. D. 1007.] The conversation often turned at Brattahlid,
on the discovery of Vinland the Good, and they said
that a voyage there had great hope of gain. And after
this Karlsefne and Snorre made ready for going on a voyage
there, the following spring. Biarne and Thorhall Gamlason,
before mentioned, joined him with a ship. There was
a man named Thorvard, who married Freydis, natural
daughter of Eric Red, and he decided to go with them, as
did also Thorvald, son<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> of Eric. And Thorhall, commonly
called the Hunter, who had been the huntsman of Eric in
the summer, and his steward in the winter, also went.
This Thorhall was a man of immense size and of great
strength, and dark complexion and taciturn, and when he
spoke, it was always jestingly. He was always inclined to
give Leif evil advice, and was an enemy of Christianity.
He knew much about desert lands; and was in the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
ship with Thorvord and Thorvald. These used the ship
which brought Thorbiorn from Iceland. There were in
all, forty men and a hundred.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> They sailed to the West
district [of Greenland], and thence to Biarney;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> hence they
sailed south a night and a day. Then land was seen, and
they launched a boat and explored the land; they found
great flat stones, many of which were twelve ells broad.
There were a great number of foxes there. They called
the land Helluland.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Then they sailed a day and a night
in a southerly course, and came to a land covered with
woods, in which there were many wild animals. Beyond
this land to the southeast, lay an island on which they slew
a bear. They called the island Bear island,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and the land,
Markland. Thence they sailed south two days and came
to a cape. The land lay on the right [starboard] side of
the ship, and there were long shores of sand. They came
to land, and found on the cape, the keel of a ship,
from which they called the place Kiarlarness,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
shores they also called Wonder-strand, because it seemed
so long sailing by. Then the land became indented with
coves, and they ran the ship into a bay,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> whither they
directed their course. King Olaf Tryggvesson had given
Leif two Scots,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> a man named Haki and a woman named
Hekia; they were swifter of foot than wild animals.
These were in Karlfsefne's ship. And when they had
passed beyond Wonder-strand, they put these Scots ashore,
and told them to run over the land to the southwest,
three days, and discover the nature of the land, and then
return. They had a kind of garment that they called
kiafal, that was so made that a hat was on top, and it was
open at the sides, and no arms; fastened between the legs
with a button and strap, otherwise they were naked.
When they returned, one had in his hand a bunch of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
grapes, and the other an ear of corn. They went on
board, and afterwards the course was obstructed by another
bay.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Beyond this bay was an island,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> on each side of
which was a rapid current, that they called the Isle of Currents.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
There was so great a number of eider ducks<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> there,
that they could hardly step without treading on their eggs.
They called this place Stream Bay.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Here they brought
their ships to land, and prepared to stay. They had with
them all kinds of cattle. The situation of the place<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> was
pleasant, but they did not care for anything, except to
explore the land. Here they wintered without sufficient
food. The next summer [A. D. 1008.] failing to catch
fish, they began to want food. Then Thorhall the Hunter
disappeared.</p>

<p>They found Thorhall, whom they sought three days, on
the top of a rock, where he lay breathing, blowing through
his nose and mouth, and muttering. They asked why he
had gone there. He replied that this was nothing that
concerned them.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> They said that he should go home with
them, which he did. Afterwards a whale was cast ashore<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
in that place; and they assembled and cut it up, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
knowing what kind of a whale it was. They boiled it
with water, and devoured it, and were taken sick. Then
Thorhall said: "Now you see that Thor<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> is more prompt
to give aid than your Christ. This was cast ashore as a
reward for the hymn which I composed to my patron
Thor, who rarely forsakes me." When they knew this,
they cast all the remains of the whale into the sea, and
commended their affairs to God. After which the air
became milder, and opportunities were given for fishing;
and from that time there was an abundance of food; and
there were beasts on the land, eggs in the island, and fish
in the sea.</p>


<p class="npara">They say that Thorhall desired to go northward around
Wonder-strand to explore Vinland, but Karlsefne wished
to go along the shore south. Then Thorhall prepared
himself at the island, but did not have more than nine
men in his whole company, and all the others went in the
company of Karlsefne. When Thorhall was carrying water
to his ship, he sang this verse:</p>

<p class="poem">
"People said when hither I<br />
Came, that I the best<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>Drink would have, but the land<br />
It justly becomes me to blame;<br />
I, a warrior, am now obliged<br />
To bear the pail;<br />
Wine touches not my lips,<br />
But I bow down to the spring."<br />
</p>

<p>And when they had made ready and were about to sail,
Thorhall sang:</p>

<p class="poem">
"Let us return<br />
Thither where [our] country-men rejoice,<br />
Let the ship try<br />
The smooth ways of the sea;<br />
While the strong heroes<br />
Live on Wonder-strand<br />
And there boil whales<br />
Which is an honor to the land."<br />
</p>

<p>Afterwards he sailed north to go around Wonder-strand
and Kiarlarness, but when he wished to sail westward,
they were met by a storm from the west and driven to
Ireland, where they were beaten and made slaves. And,
as merchants<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> reported, there Thorhall died.</p>

<p>It is said that Karlsefne, with Snorre and Biarne and
his comrades, sailed along the coast south. They sailed
long until they came to a river flowing out from the land
through a lake into the sea, where there were sandy shoals,
where it was impossible to pass up, except with the
highest tide. Karlsefne sailed up to the mouth of the
river with his folk, and called the place Hop.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
come to the land, they saw that where the ground was low
corn<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> grew, and where it was higher, vines were found.
Every river was full of fish.</p>

<p>They dug pits where the land began, and where the
land was highest; and when the tide went down, there
were sacred fish<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> in the pits. There were a great number
of all kinds of wild beasts in the woods. They stayed there
half a month and enjoyed themselves, and did not notice
anything; they had their cattle with them. And early
one morning, when they looked around, they saw a great
many skin boats, and poles were swung upon them, and
it sounded like reeds shaken by the wind, and they pointed
to the sun. Then said Karlsefne, "What may this mean?"
Snorre Thorbrandson replied, "It may be that this is a
sign of peace, so let us take a white shield and hold it
towards them." They did so. Thereupon they rowed
towards them, wondering at them, and came to land.
These people were swarthy and fierce, and had bushy hair
on their heads; they had very large eyes and broad cheeks.
They stayed there for a time, and gazed upon those they
met, and afterwards rowed away southward around the ness.</p>

<p>Karlsefne and his people had made their houses above
the lake, and some of the houses were near the lake, and
others more distant. They wintered there, and there was
no snow, and all their cattle fed themselves on the grass.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
But when spring came [A. D. 1009.] they saw one morning
early, that a number of canoes rowed from the south
round the ness; so many, as if the sea were sown with
coal; poles were also swung on each boat. Karlsefne and
his people then raised up the shield, and when they came
together they began to trade; and these people would
rather have red cloth; for this they offered skins and real
furs. They would also buy swords and spears, but this,
Karlsefne and Snorre forbade. For a whole fur skin, the
Skr&aelig;llings took a piece of red cloth, a span long, and
bound it round their heads. Thus went on their traffic
for a time; then the cloth began to be scarce with Karlsefne
and his people, and they cut it up into small pieces,
which were not wider than a finger's breath, and yet the
Skr&aelig;llings gave just as much as before, and more.</p>

<p>It happened that a bull, which Karlsefne had, ran out of
the wood and roared aloud; this frightened the Skr&aelig;llings,
and they rushed to their canoes and rowed away toward
the south; and after that they were not seen for three
whole weeks. But at the end of that time, a great number
of Skr&aelig;lling's ships were seen coming from the south like
a rushing torrent, all the poles turned from the sun, and
they all yelled very loud. Then Karlsefne's people took
a red<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> shield and held it towards them. The Skr&aelig;llings
leaped out of their vessels, and after this, they went
against each other and fought. There was a hot shower
of weapons, because the Skr&aelig;llings had slings. Karlsefne's
people saw that they raised up on a pole, a very large
ball, something like a sheep's paunch, and of a blue color;
this they swung from the pole over Karlsefne's men, upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the ground, and it made a great noise as it fell down.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
This caused great fear with Karlsefne and his men, so that
they only thought of running away, and they retreated
along the river, for it seemed to them that the Skr&aelig;llings
pressed them on all sides; they did not stop until they
came to some rocks, where they made a bold stand. Freydis
came out and saw that Karlsefne's people fell back, and
she cried out, "Why do you run, strong men as you are,
before these miserable creatures, whom I thought you
would knock down like cattle? And if I had arms,
methinks I could fight better than any of you." They
gave no heed to their words. Freydis would go with them,
but she was slower, because she was pregnant; still she
followed after them into the woods. She found a dead
man in the woods; it was Thorbrand Snorreson, and there
stood a flat stone stuck in his head; the sword lay
naked by his side. This she took up, and made ready to
defend herself. Then came the Skr&aelig;llings toward her;
she drew out her breasts from under her clothes, and
dashed them against the naked sword;<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> by this the Skr&aelig;llings
became frightened and ran off to their ships, and
rowed away. Karlsefne and his men then came up and
praised her courage. Two men fell on Karlsefne's side,
but a number of the Skr&aelig;llings. Karlsefne's band was overmatched.
And now they went home to their dwellings
and bound up their wounds; and considered what crowd
that was that pressed upon them from the land side, and
it now seemed to them that it could have hardly been real
people from the ships, but that these must have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
optical illusions. The Skr&aelig;llings also found a dead man,
and an axe lay by him; one of them took up the axe and
cut wood with it; and then one after another did the same,
and thought it was a fine thing and cut well. After that,
one took it and cut at a stone, so that the axe broke, and
then they thought that it was of no use, because it would
not cut stone, and they cast it away.</p>

<p>Karlsefne and his people now thought that they saw,
although the land had many good qualities, that they still
would always be exposed there to the fear of attacks from
the original dwellers.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> They decided, therefore, to go
away, and to return to their own land. They coasted
northward along the shore,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> and found five Skr&aelig;llings clad
in skins, sleeping near the sea. They had with them
vessels containing animal marrow, mixed with blood.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
Karlsefne's people thought that these men had been banished
from the land; they killed them. After that they came
to a ness, and many wild beasts were there, and the ness
was covered all over with dung, from the beasts which had
lain there during the night. Now they came back to
Straumfiord, and there was a plenty of everything that
they wanted to have. [It is thus that some men say, that
Biarne and Gudrid stayed behind, and one hundred men
with them, and did not go farther; but that Karlsefne and
Snorre went southward, and forty men with them, and
were not longer in Hop than barely two months, and the
same summer came back.]<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Karlsefne then went with one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
ship to seek Thorhall the Hunter, but the rest remained
behind, and they sailed northward past Kiarlarness, and
thence westward, and the land was upon their larboard
hand. There were wild woods over all, as far as they
could see, and scarcely any open places. And when they
had sailed long a river ran out of the land from east
to west. They sailed into the mouth of the river, and lay
by its banks.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<hr class="half" />

<p>It chanced one morning that Karlsefne and his people
saw opposite in an open place in the woods, a speck which
glittered in their sight, and they called out towards it, and
it was a Uniped,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> which thereupon hurried down to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
bank of the river, where they lay. Thorvald Ericson
stood at the helm, and the Uniped shot an arrow into his
bowels. Thorvald drew out the arrow and said: "It has
killed me! To a rich land we have come, but hardly shall
we enjoy any benefit from it." Thorvald soon after died<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
of his wound. Upon this the Uniped ran away to the
northward; Karlsefne and his people went after him, and
saw him now and then, and the last time they saw him, he
ran out into a bay. Then they turned back, and a man
sang these verses:</p>

<p class="poem">
The people chased<br />
A uniped<br />
Down to the beach.<br />
Behold he ran<br />
Straight over the sea&mdash;<br />
Hear thou, Thorfinn!<br />
</p>

<p>They drew off to the northward, and saw the country of
the Unipeds; they would not then expose their men any
longer. They looked upon the mountain range that was
at Hop, and that which they now found,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> as all one, and it
also appeared to be of equal length from Straumfiord to
both places. The third winter they were in Straumfiord.
They now became much divided by party feeling, and the
women were the cause of it, for those who were unmarried
would injure those who were married, and hence arose
great disturbance. There was born the first autumn,
Snorre, Karlsefne's son, and he was three years old when
they went away. When they sailed from Vinland they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
had a south wind, and then came to Markland, and found
there, five Skr&aelig;llings, and one was bearded; two were
females, and two boys; they took the boys, but the others
escaped, and the Skr&aelig;llings sank down in the ground.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
These boys they took with them; they taught them the
language, and they were baptized. They called their
mother Vathelldi, and their father, Uv&aelig;ge. They said
that two kings ruled over the Skr&aelig;llings, and that one was
named Avalldania, but the other Valldidia. They said
that no houses were there; people lay in caves or in holes.
They said there was a land on the other side, just opposite
their country, where people lived who wore white clothes,
and carried poles before them, and to these were fastened
flags, and they shouted loud; and the people think that
this was White-man's land, or Great Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<hr class="half" />

<p>Biarne Grimolfson was driven with his ship into the
Irish ocean, and they came into a worm sea,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and soon
the ship began to sink under them. They had a boat
which was smeared with sea oil, for the worms do not
attack that. They went into the boat, and then saw that
it could not hold them all. Then said Biarne: "As the
boat will not hold more than half of our men, it is my
counsel that lots should be drawn for those to go in the
boat, for it shall not be according to rank." This, they
all thought so generous an offer, that no one would oppose
it. They then did so that lots were drawn, and it fell to
Biarne to go in the boat, and the half of the men with him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
for the boat had not room for more. But when they had
gotten into the boat, an Icelandic man that was in the
ship, and had come with Biarne from Iceland, said: "Dost
thou mean, Biarne, to leave me here?" Biarne said: "So
it seems." Then said the other: "Very different was the
promise to my father, when I went with thee from Iceland,
than thus to leave me, for thou said that we should both
share the same fate." Biarne said, "It shall not be thus;
go down into the boat, and I will go up into the ship, since
I see that thou art so anxious to live."<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Then Biarne
went up into the ship, and this man down into the boat, and
after that they went on their voyage, until they came to
Dublin, in Ireland, and there told these things; but it is
most people's belief that Biarne and his companions were
lost in the worm sea, for nothing was heard of them after
that time.</p>


<h4>THE ACCOUNT OF THORFINN.</h4>

<p>That same winter [A. D. 1006-7.] there was much discussion
about the affairs of Brattahlid; and they set up the
game of chess, and sought amusement in the reciting of
history,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> and in many other things, and were able to pass
life joyfully. And Karlsefne and Snorre resolved to seek
Vinland, but there was much discussion about it. But it
turned out that Karlsefne and Snorre prepared their ships
to seek Vinland the following summer. [A. D. 1007.]
And in this enterprise Biarne and Thorhall joined as comrades
with their own ship and crew, who were their
followers. There was a man named Thorvald, a relation<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of Eric. Thorhall was called the Hunter; he long had
hunted with Eric in summer, and had the care of many
things. Thorhall was of great stature, large and swarthy
face, of a hard nature, taciturn, saying little of affairs, and
nevertheless crafty and malicious, always inclined to evil,
and opposed in his mind to the Christian religion, from its
first introduction into Greenland. Thorhall indulged in
trifling, but nevertheless Eric was used to his familiarity.
He went in the ship with Thorvald, and was well acquainted
with uninhabitable places. He used the ship in
which Thorbiorn came; and Karlsefne engaged comrades
for the expedition; and the best part of the sailors of
Greenland were with him. They carried in their ships,
forty and a hundred men. Afterwards they sailed to West
bygd and Biarney-isle. They sailed from Biarney-isle
with a north wind, and were on the sea day and night,
when they found land, and sending a boat to the shore,
explored the land, where they found many flat stones of
such great size, that they exceeded in length the size of
two men. There were foxes there. And they gave the
land a name, and called it Helluland. After this, they
sailed a night and a day with a north wind. They came
to a land in which were great woods and many animals.
Southwest, opposite the land, lay an island. Here they
found a bear, and called the island, Bear island. This
land, where there were woods, they called Markland.
After a voyage of a day and a night, they saw land, and
they sailed near the land and saw that it was a cape; they
kept close to the shore with the wind on the starboard side,
and left the land upon the right side of the ship. There
were places without harbors, long shores and sands. When
they went to the shore with a boat, they found the keel of
a ship, and they called the place, Kiarlarness;<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
gave the shore a name, and called it Wonder-strand,
because they were so long going by. Then another bay
extended into the land, and they steered into the bay.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
When Leif was with King Olaf Tryggvesson, he sent him
to establish the Christian religion in Greenland; then the
king gave him two Scots-folk, a man named Hake, and a
woman named Hekia. The king told Leif to take them
with his men, if he would have his commands done quickly,
as they were swifter than beasts. These folk, Leif and
Eric gave to Karlsefne, as followers. When they were
come opposite Wonder-strand, they put the Scots on the
shore, and told them to run southward and explore the
country, and return before the end of three days. They
were thus clothed, having a garment called a Biafal;<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> it
was made so that a hat was on top, open at the sides,
without arms, buttoned between the legs, and fastened
with a button and strap; and the rest was bare.</p>

<p>They came to anchor and lay by, until the three days
passed, when they returned, one having in his hand a vine,
and the other, self-sown wheat. Karlsefne said that they
had found a fruitful land. Afterwards they were received
into the ship, and they went on their way until a bay
intersected the land. They steered the ship into the bay.
On the outside was an island, and there was a great tide
around the island. This they called, Straumey.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> There
was a great number of birds, and it was scarcely possible
to find a place for their feet among the eggs. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
they steered into a long bay which they called Straumfiord,
where they landed from their ships and began to
prepare habitations. They brought with them all kinds
of cattle, and they found sufficient pasturage. There were
mountains, and the prospect was pleasant. But they
cared for nothing, except to explore the land; there was
a great abundance of grass. Here they wintered, and the
winter was severe, and they did not have stores laid up,
they began to be in want of food, and failed to catch fish.
So they sailed over to the island,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> hoping that they might
find means of subsistence, either on what they could catch,
or what was cast ashore. But they found but little better
fare, though the cattle were better off. [A. D. 1008.]
Afterwards they prayed to God, to send them food; which
prayer was not answered as soon as desired. Then Thorhall
disappeared, and a search was made, which lasted
three days. On the morning of the fourth day, Karlsefne
and Biarne found him lying on the top of a rock; there he
lay stretched out, with open eyes, blowing through his
mouth, and muttering to himself. They asked him why
he had gone there. He replied that it did not concern
them and not to wonder, as he was old enough to take care
of himself, without their troubling themselves with his
affairs. They asked him to go home with them; this he
did. After that a whale was cast up, and they ran down
to cut it up; nevertheless they did not know what kind it
was. Neither did Karlsefne, though acquainted with
whales, know this one. Then the cooks dressed the
whale, and they all ate of it, and it made them all sick.
Then Thorhall said, "It is clear now that the Red-beard
is more prompt to give aid than your Christ. This food
is a reward for a hymn which I made to my god Thor,
who has seldom deserted me." When they heard this,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
none would eat any more, and threw what was left from
the rock, committing themselves to God. After this the
opportunity was given of going after fish, and there was
no lack of food. They sailed into Straumfiord, and had
abundance of food and hunting on the mainland, with
many eggs, and fish from the sea.</p>

<p>And now they began to consider where they should
settle next. Thorhall the Hunter wished to go northward
around Wonder-strand and Kiarlarness to explore Vinland,
but Karlsefne wished to go southwest, thinking
likely that there would be larger tracts of country the
further they went south. Thorhall made ready at the
island, and only nine men went with him, all the rest of
the ship folk went with Karlsefne. One day Thorhall was
carrying water to his ship; he drank it and sang this verse:</p>

<p class="poem">
"People promised me when hither I<br />
Came, then the best drink<br />
I should have; but the country<br />
I must denounce to all;<br />
Here you are forced by hand<br />
To bear the pail to the water,<br />
I must bend me down to the spring;<br />
Wine did not come to my lips."<br />
</p>

<p>Afterwards they left the land, and Karlsefne went with
them to the island. Before they hoisted sail, Thorhall
sang these verses:</p>

<p class="poem">
"Let us return<br />
Home to our countrymen,<br />
Let the vessel try<br />
The broad path of the sea;<br />
While the persevering<br />
Men, who praise the land<br />
Are building, and boil the whales<br />
Here on Wonder-strand."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p class="noidt">Thereupon they sailed northward around Wonder-strand
and Kialarness. But when they wished to cruise westward,
a storm came against them, and drove them to
Ireland, where they were beaten and made slaves. There
Thorhall passed his life.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Karlsefne, with Snorre and Biarne and the rest of his
comrades, sailed south. They sailed long until they came
to a river, which flowed from the land through a lake, and
passed into the sea. Before the mouth of the river were
great islands, and they were not able to enter the river
except at the highest tide.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Karlsefne sailed into the mouth
of the river, and called the land Hop. There they found
fields, where the land was low, with wild corn, and where
the land was high, were vines. And every river was full
of fish. They made pits in the sand, where the tide rose
highest, and at low tide, sacred fish were found in these
pits, and in the woods was a great number of all kinds of
beasts. Here they stayed half a month, enjoying themselves,
but observing nothing new. Early one morning,
on looking around, they saw nine skin boats, in which
were poles that, vibrating towards the sun, gave out a
sound like reeds shaken by the wind. Then Karlsefne
said: "What, think you, does this mean?" Snorre said:
"It is possible that it is a sign of peace; let us raise up
a white shield and hold it towards them:" this they did.
Then they rowed towards them, wondering at them, and
came to land. These men were small of stature and fierce,
having a bushy head of hair, and very great eyes and wide
cheeks. They remained some time wondering at them,
and afterwards rowed southward around the cape. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
built dwellings beyond the lake, others made houses near
the mainland, and others near the lake. Here they spent
the winter. No snow fell,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> and all their cattle fed under
the open sky. They decided to explore all the mountains<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
that were in Hop; which done, they [A. D. 1009.] went and
passed the third winter in Straum bay. At this time they
had much contention among themselves, and the unmarried
women vexed the married. The first autumn, Snorre,
Karlsefne's son, was born, and he [was three years old]
when they went away. They had a south wind, and came
to Markland, and found five Skr&aelig;llings, of whom one
was a man, and two women, and two were boys. Karlsefne
took the boys, and the others escaped and sank down
into the earth. They carried the boys away with them,
and taught them the language, and they were baptized.
And the name of their mother was Vatheldi, and their
father, Uv&aelig;ge. They said that two kings ruled over the
Skr&aelig;llinger's land, one was named Avalldania, and the
other, Valldidia; that they had no houses, but lived in
dens and caves. In another part of the country, there was
a region where the people wore white clothes, and shouted
loud, and carried poles with flags. This they thought to
be White-man's land. After this they came into Greenland,
and passed the winter with Leif, son of Eric Red.
Biarne Grimolfson was carried out into the Greenland<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> sea,
and came into a worm sea, which they did not observe,
until their ship was full of worm holes. They considered
what should be done. They had a stern boat, smeared
with oil; they say that wood covered with oil, the worms
will not bore. The result of the council was, that as many
should go into the boat as it would hold. It then appeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
that the boat would not hold more than one-half of the
men. Then Biarne ordered that the men should go in
the boat by lot, and not according to rank. And as
it would not hold all, they accepted the proposition, and
when the lots were drawn, the men went out of the ship
into the boat. And the lot was that Biarne should go
down from the ship to the boat with one-half of the men.
Then those to whom the lot fell, went down from the
ship to the boat. And when they had come into the boat,
a young Icelander, who was the companion of Biarne,
said: "Now thus do you intend to leave me, Biarne?"
Biarne replied, "That now seems necessary." He replied
with these words: "Thou art not true to the promise
made when I left my father's house in Iceland." Biarne
replied: "In this thing I do not see any other way;" continuing,
"What course can you suggest?" He said, "I
see this, that we change places and thou come up here
and I go there." Biarne replied: "Let it be so, since I
see that you are so anxious to live, and are frightened by
the prospect of death." Then they changed places, and
he descended into the boat with the men, and Biarne went
up into the ship. And it is related that Biarne, and the
sailors with him in the ship, perished in the worm sea.
Those who went in the boat, went on their course until
they came to land, where they told all these things.</p>

<p>After the next summer, Karlsefne went to Iceland with
his son Snorre, and he went to his own home at Reikianess.
The daughter of Snorre, son of Karlsefne, was
Hallfrida, mother to Bishop Thorlak Runolfson. They
had a son named Thorbiorn, whose daughter was named
Thoruna, mother of Bishop Biarne. Thorgeir was the
name of the other son of Snorre Karlsefne's son, father to
Ingveld, and mother of the first bishop of Brand. And
this is the end of the history.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<h4>THIRD NARRATIVE.</h4>

<p>That same summer came a ship from Norway to Greenland.
The man was called Thorfinn Karlsefne, who steered
the ship. He was a son of Thord Hesth&ouml;fde, a son of
Snorre Thordarson, from H&ouml;fda. Thorfinn Karlsefne was
a man of great wealth, and was in Brattahlid with Leif
Ericsson. Soon he fell in love with Gudrid, and courted
her, and she referred to Leif to answer for her. Afterwards
she was betrothed to him, and their wedding was held
the same winter. At this time, as before, much was spoken
about a Vinland voyage; and both Gudrid and others
persuaded Karlsefne much to that expedition. Now this
expedition was resolved upon, and they got ready a crew
of sixty men, and five women;<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and then they made the
agreement, Karlsefne and his people, that each of them
should have equal share in what they made of gain. They
had with them all kinds of cattle,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> having the intention
to settle in the land, if they could. Karlsefne asked Leif
for his houses in Vinland, but he said he would lend them,
but not give them. Then they put to sea with the ship,
and came to Leif's houses<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> safe, and carried up their goods,
They soon had in hand a great and good prize, for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
whale had been driven on shore, both large and excellent.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
They went to it and cut it up, and had no want of food.
Their cattle went up into the land; but soon they were
unruly, and gave trouble to them, They had one bull
with them. Karlsefne let wood be felled and hewed for
shipping it, and had it laid on a rock to dry. They had
all the good of the products of the land, which were these:
both grapes and wood, and other products. After that
first winter, and when summer came, [A. D. 1008.] they
were aware of Skr&aelig;llings being there; and a great troop of
men came out of the woods. The cattle were near to them,
and the bull began to bellow and roar very loud, and with
that the Skr&aelig;llings were frightened, and made off with
their bundles&mdash;and these were of furs and sables and all
sorts of skins; and they turned and wanted to go into the
houses, but Karlsefne defended the doors. Neither party
understood the language of the other. Then the Skr&aelig;llings
took their bundles and opened them, and wanted to have
weapons in exchange for them, but Karlsefne forbade his
men to sell weapons. Then he adopted this plan with them,
that he told the women to bear out milk and dairy products
to them; and when they saw these things, they would buy
them and nothing else. And now the trade for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Skr&aelig;llings was such, that they carried away their winnings
in their stomachs; and Karlsefne and his comrades got
both their bags and skin goods, and so they went away.
And now it is to be told, that Karlsefne let a good strong
fence be made around the habitation, and strengthened it
for defense. At this time, Gudrid,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Karlsefne's wife, lay
in of a male child, and the child was called Snorre. In
the beginning of the next winter, came the Skr&aelig;llings
again to them, and in much greater numbers than before,
and with the same kind of wares. Then said Karlsefne to
the women, "Now ye shall carry out the same kind of food
as was best liked the last time, and nothing else." And
when they saw that they threw their bundles in over the fence:
and Gudrid sat in the door within, by the cradle of Snorre,
her son. Then came a shadow to the door, and a woman
went in with a black kirtle on, rather short, with a snood
around her head; clear, yellow hair; pale; with large
eyes, so large that none ever saw such eyes in a human
head. She went to where Gudrid was sitting, and said:
"What art thou called?" "I am called Gudrid; and
what art thou called?" "I am called Gudrid, said she."
Then the goodwife, Gudrid, put out her hand to her, that
she might sit down beside her. And at the same time
Gudrid heard a great noise, and the woman had vanished;<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
and at the same time one of the Skr&aelig;llings was killed
by one of Karlsefne's house men, because he was about to
take one of their weapons; and they made off as soon as
possible, leaving behind them goods and clothes. No one
had seen this woman but Gudrid. "Now," says Karlsefne,
"we must be cautious, and take counsel; for I think they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
will come the third time with hostility and many people.
We shall now take the plan, that ten men go out to the
ness and show themselves there, and the rest of our men
shall go into the woods and make a clearance for our
cattle against the time the enemy comes out of the forest;
and we shall take the bull before us, and let him go in
front." And it happened so that at the place where they
were to meet, there was a lake on the one side, and the forest
on the other. The plan which Karlsefne had laid down,
was adopted. The Skr&aelig;llings came to the place where
Karlsefne proposed to fight; and there was a battle there,
and many of the Skr&aelig;llings fell. There was one stout,
handsome man among the Skr&aelig;llings people, and Karlsefne
thought that he must be their chief. One of the Skr&aelig;llings
had taken up an axe and looked at it awhile, and
wielded it against one of his comrades and cut him down,
so that he fell dead instantly. Then the stout man took
the axe,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> looked at it awhile, and threw it into the sea as
far as he could. They then fled to the woods as fast as
they could, and so ended the fight. Karlsefne stayed there
with his men the whole winter; but towards spring he
made known that he would not stay there any longer,
and would return to Greenland.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Now they prepared for
their voyage and took much goods from thence&mdash;vines,
grapes and skin wares. They put to sea, and their ship
came to Ericsfiord, and they there passed the winter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>The following summer,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> [A. D. 1011.] Karlsefne went
to Iceland and Gudrid with him, and he went home to
Reikianess. His mother felt that he had made a poor
match, and for this reason Gudrid was not at home the
first winter. But when she saw that Gudrid was a noble
woman, she went home, and they got on well together.
Halfrid was the daughter of Snorre Karlsefnesson, mother
to Bishop Thorlak Runolfson. Their son was named
Thorbiorn, and his daughter, Thoruna, mother to Bishop
Biorne. Thorgeir was the son of Snorre Karlsefnesson,
father to Ingveld, mother of the first Bishop Brand.
Snorre Karlsefnesson had a daughter, Steinun, who married
Einar, son of Grundarketil, son of Thorvald Krok, the son
of Thorer, of Espihol; their son was Thorstein Rauglatr.
He was father to Gudrun, who married Jorund of Keldum.
Halla was their daughter, and she was mother to Flose,
father of Valgerda, who was mother of Herr Erland
Sterka, father of Herr Hauk, the Lagman.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Another
daughter of Flose was Thordis, mother of Fru Ingigerd
the Rich; her daughter was Fru Hallbera, Abbess of Stad,
in Reikianess. Many other distinguished men in Iceland
are the descendants of Karlsefne and Thurid, who are not
here mentioned. God be with us. Amen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="VIII_THE_VOYAGE_OF_FREYDIS_HELGE_AND" id="VIII_THE_VOYAGE_OF_FREYDIS_HELGE_AND"></a>VIII. THE VOYAGE OF FREYDIS, HELGE AND FINBOGE.</h3>



<p>This narrative is found in <i>Antiquitates American&aelig;</i>, p. 65.
It shows that history, among the Icelanders, was not
made subservient to family interests. At the conclusion
we have a (supplementary) notice of Thorfinn and Gudrid,
after their return to Iceland.</p>

<hr class="half" />

<p>Now the conversation began again to turn upon a Vinland
voyage, as the expedition was both gainful and
honorable. The same summer [A. D. 1010.] that Karlsefne
returned from Vinland, a ship arrived in Greenland from
Norway. Two brothers commanded the ship, Helge and
Finboge; and they remained that winter in Greenland.
The brothers were of Icelandic descent from Earlfiord. It
is now to be told, that Freydis, Eric's daughter, came home
from Garda,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and went to the abode of Finboge and
Helge, and proposed to them that they should go to Vinland
with their vessel, and have half with her of all the
goods they could get there. They agreed to this. Then
she went to the abode of her brother Leif, and asked him
to give her the houses he had built in Vinland; and he
answered as before, that he would lend, but not give the
houses. It was agreed upon between the brothers and
Freydis, that each should have thirty fighting men, besides
women. But Freydis broke this, and had five men more,
and concealed them; and the brothers knew nothing of it
until they arrived in Vinland.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> They went to sea, and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
agreed beforehand to sail in company, if they could do so:
and the difference was little, although the brothers came
a little earlier, and had carried up their baggage to Leif's
houses. And when Freydis came to the land, her people
cleared the ship, and carried her baggage also up to the
house. Then said Freydis: "Why are you carrying your
things in here?" "Because we thought," said they,
"that the whole of the agreement with us should be held."
She said, "Leif lent the houses to me, not to you." Then
said Helge, "In evil, we brothers cannot strive with thee:"
and bore out their luggage and made a shed, and built it
farther from the sea, on the borders of a lake,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> and set all
about it in order. Freydis let trees be cut down for her
ship's cargo. Now winter set in, and the brothers proposed
to have some games for amusement to pass the time.
So it was done for a time, till discord came among them,
and the games were given up, and none went from one
house to the other; and things went on so during a great
part of the winter. It happened one morning that Freydis
got out of her berth, and put on her clothes, but not her
shoes; and the weather was such that much dew had fallen.
She took the cloak of her husband over her, and went out,
and went to the house of the brothers, and to the door. A
man had gone out a little before and left the door behind
him, half shut. She opened the door, and stood in the
doorway a little, and was silent. Finboge lay the farthest
inside the hut, and was awake. He said: "What wilt
thou have here, Freydis?" She said, "I want thee to get
up and go out with me, for I would speak with thee."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
He did so: they went to a tree that was lying under the
eaves of the hut, and sat down. "How dost thou like
this place?" said she. He said, "The country, methinks,
is good; but I do not like this quarrel that has arisen
among us, for I think there is no cause for it." "Thou
art right," says she, "and I think so too; and it is my
errand to thy dwelling, that I want to buy the ship of
your brothers, as your ship is larger than mine, and I
would break up from hence." "I will let it be so," said he,
"if that will please thee." Now they parted so, and she
went home, and Finboge to his bed. She went up into
her berth, and with her cold feet awakened Thorvard, who
asked why she was so cold and wet. She answered with
great warmth, "I went to these brothers," said she, "to
treat about their ship, for I want a larger ship;<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and they
took it so ill, that they struck and abused me. And, thou,
useless man! wilt neither avenge my affront, nor thy own;
and now must I feel that I am away from Greenland, but
I will separate<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> from thee if thou dost not avenge this."
And now he could not bear her reproaches, and told his
men to rise as fast as possible, and take their weapons.
They did so, and went to the tents of the brothers, and
went in as they lay asleep, and seized them all, bound them,
and led them out bound, one after the other, and Freydis
had each of them put to death, as he came out. Now all
the men were killed; but the women were left, and nobody
would kill them. Then said Freydis, "Give me an axe in
my hand." This was done, and she turned on those five
women, and did not give over until they were all dead.
Now they returned to their own hut after this evil deed;
and the people could only observe that Freydis thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
she had done exceedingly well; and she said to her comrades,
"If it be our lot to return to Greenland, I shall take
the life of the man who speaks of this affair; and we shall
say that we left them here when we went away." Now
they got ready the ship early in spring [A. D. 1011.] which
had belonged to the brothers, with all the goods they could
get on, that the ship would carry, sailed out to sea, and
had a good voyage; and the ship came early in the summer
to Ericsfiord. Karlsefne was there still,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and had his ship
ready for sea, but waited a wind; and it was a common
saying that never a richer ship sailed from Greenland than
that which he steered.</p>

<p>Freydis went home now to her house, which had stood
without damage in the meanwhile. She bestowed many
gifts on her followers, that they might conceal her wickedness;
and she remained now on her farm. All were not
so silent about their misdeeds and wickedness, that something
did not come up about it. This came at last to the
ears of Leif, her brother, and he thought this report was
very bad. Leif took three men of Freydis's followers, and
tortured them to speak, and they acknowledged the whole
affair, and their tales agreed together. "I do not care,"
says Leif, "to treat my sister as she deserves; but this I
will foretell them, that their posterity will never thrive."
And it went so that nobody thought anything of them but
evil, from that time.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Now we have to say that Karlsefne
got ready his ship, and sailed out to sea.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> He came on well,
and reached Norway safely, and remained there all winter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and sold his wares; and he, and his wife, were held in
esteem by the best people in Norway. Now in the following
spring, he fitted out his ship for Iceland, and when he
was quite ready, and his ship lay outside the pier waiting
a wind, there came to him a south-country man, from
Bremen, in Saxon land, who would deal with him for his
house-bar.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> "I will not sell it," said he. "I will give
thee half a mark of gold for it," said the south-country
man. Karlsefne thought it was a good offer, and sold it
accordingly. The south-country man went away with his
house-bar, and Karlsefne did not know what wood it was.
It was massur-wood<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> from Vinland. Now Karlsefne put
to sea, [A. D. 1012.] and his ship came to land north at
Skagafiord,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> and there he put up his vessel for winter. In
spring he purchased Glamb&aelig;irland,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> where he took up his
abode, and dwelt there as long as he lived, and was a man
of great consideration; and many men are descended from
him and his wife Gudrid, and it was a good family.
When Karlsefne died, Gudrid took the management of his
estates, and of Snorre her son, who was born in Vinland.
And when Snorre was married, Gudrid went out of the
country, and went to the south,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and came back again to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Snorre's estate, and he had built a church at Glamb&aelig;.
Afterwards Gudrid became a nun, and lived a hermit's
life, and did so as long as she lived.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Snorre had a son
called Thorgeir, who was father to Bishop Brand's mother,
Ingveld. The daughter of Snorre Karlsefnesson was
called Halfrid. She was mother of Runolf, the father of
Bishop Thorlak. Karlsefne and Gudrid also had a son
called Bi&ouml;rn. He was father of Thoruna, the mother of
Bishop Bi&ouml;rn. Many people are descended from Karlsefne,
and his kin have been lucky; and Karlsefne has
given the most particular accounts of all these travels, of
which something is here related.</p>

<h3><a name="I_ARE_MARSON_IN_HVITRAMANNA-LAND" id="I_ARE_MARSON_IN_HVITRAMANNA-LAND"></a>I. ARE MARSON IN HVITRAMANNA-LAND.</h3>


<p>This narrative is from the <i>Landnama-bok</i>, No. 107.
Folio; collated with Hauksbok, Melabok and other manuscripts,
in the <i>Arn&aelig;-Magn&aelig;an</i> Collection.</p>

<p>It has frequently been observed that the <i>Landnama-bok</i>
is of the highest authority; yet we must remember that it
only proves the fact, that Rafn, the Limerick merchant,
conveyed the narrative to Iceland from Ireland, where the
circumstances were well known. The <i>Landnama-bok</i>, while
it gives a tacit approval of the statements of the narrative,
does not enter upon the question of the locality of the
place to which Are Marson went. Therefore while we
accept the narrative as genuine history, we should exercise
due caution in determining the locality of Hvitramanna-land.
Nothing is to be gained by making any
forced deductions from the narrative; especially as the
pre-Columbian discovery of America is abundantly proved,
without the aid of this, or any other of the Minor Narratives.</p>

<p>Ulf the Squinter, son of Hogni the White, took the
whole of Reikianess between Thorkafiord and Hafrafell;
he married Bi&ouml;rg, daughter of Eyvind the Eastman,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> sister<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
to Helge the Lean. They had a son named Atli the Red,
who married Thorbiorg, sister of Steinolf the Humble.
Their son was named Mar of Holum, who married Thorkatla,
daughter of Hergil Neprass. She had a son named
Are, who [A. D. 928.] was driven by a storm to White-man's
land,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> which some call Ireland the Great, which lies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>

baptized<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> there. This was first told by Rafn, the
Lime<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>rick trader, who lived for a long time in Ireland. So also
Thorkel, son of Geller, tells that certain Icelanders said,
who heard Thorfinn, Earl of the Orkneys, say, that Are
had been seen and known in White-man's land, and that,
though not allowed to leave, he was held in much honor.
Are had a wife named Thorgeir, daughter of Alf of Dolum.
Their sons were Thorgils, Gudleif and Illuge, which is
the family of Reikianess. Jorund was the son of Ulf the

<h3><a name="II_BIORN_ASBRANDSON" id="II_BIORN_ASBRANDSON"></a>II. BI&Ouml;RN ASBRANDSON.</h3>


<p>This narrative is taken from Eyrbyggia Saga, which
contains the early history of that part of Iceland lying
around Sn&aelig;fells, on the west coast. The Saga is not of a
later date than the thirteenth century. It is given here, not
because it applies largely to the question under consideration,
the pre-Columbian discovery of America, but rather
because it will make the reader fully acquainted with the
hero, who afterwards appears.</p>

<hr class="half" />
<p>Bork the Fat, and Thordis, daughter of Sur, had a
daughter named Thurid, who married Thorbi&ouml;rn the Fat,
living on the estate of Froda. He was a son of Orne the
Lean, who held and tilled the farm of Froda. Thorbi&ouml;rn
had before been married to Thurid, daughter of Asbrand,
of Kamb, in Breidavik, and sister of Bi&ouml;rn Breidaviking
the Athlete, soon to be mentioned in this Saga, and of
Arnbi&ouml;rn the Handy. The sons of Thorbi&ouml;rn and Thurid,
were Ketil the Champion, Gunnlaug and Hallstein.</p>

<p>Now this must be related of Snorre the Priest,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> that he
undertook the suit for the slaying of Thorbi&ouml;rn, his kinsman.
He also caused his sister to remove to his own
home, at Helgefell, because it was reported that Bi&ouml;rn
Asbrand, of Kamb, had come to pay her improper attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a man named Thorodd, of Medalfells Strand,
an upright man and a good merchant. He owned a
trading vessel in which he sailed to distant lands. Thorodd
had sailed to the west,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> to Dublin, on a trading
voyage. At that time, Sigurd<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Hlodverson, Earl of the
Orkneys, had made an expedition towards the west, to the
Hebrides and the Man, and had laid a tribute upon
the habitable part of Man. Having settled the peace, he
left men to collect the tribute; the earl himself returned to
the Orkneys. Those who were left to collect the tribute,
got all ready and set sail with a southwest wind. But
after they had sailed some time, to the southeast and east,
a great storm arose, which drove them to the northward
as far as Ireland, and their vessel was cast away
on a barren, uninhabited island. Just as they reached the
island, Thorodd the Icelander came sailing by from
Dublin. The shipwrecked men begged for aid. Thorodd
put out a boat and went to them himself. When he
reached them, the agents of Sigurd promised him money
if he would carry them to their home in the Orkneys.
When he told them that he could by no means do so, as
he had made all ready to go back to Iceland, they begged
the harder, believing that neither their money nor their
liberty would be safe in Ireland or the Hebrides, whither
they had just before been with a hostile army. At length
Thorodd came to this, that he would sell them his ship's
long-boat for a large sum of the tribute money; in this
they reached the Orkneys, and Thorodd sailed to Iceland
without a boat. Having reached the southern shores of
the island, he laid his course along the coast to the westward,
and entered Breidafiord, and came to the harbor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
at D&ouml;gurdarness. The same autumn he went to Helgefell
to spend the winter with Snorre the Priest; and from
that time he was called Thorodd the Tribute Taker.
This took place just after the murder of Thorbi&ouml;rn the
Fat. During the same winter, Thurid, the sister of Snorre
the Priest, who had been the wife of Thorbi&ouml;rn the Fat,
was at Helgefell. Thorodd made proposals of marriage to
Snorre the Priest, with respect to Thurid. Being rich,
and known by Snorre to be of good repute, and that he
would be useful in supporting his administration of affairs,
he consented. Therefore their marriage was celebrated
during this winter, at Snorre's house, at Helgefell. In the
following spring, Thorodd set himself up at Froda, and
was thought an upright man. But when Thurid went to
Froda, Bi&ouml;rn Asbrandson often paid her visits, and it was
commonly reported that he had corrupted her chastity.
Thorodd vainly tried to put an end to these visits. At
that time Thorodd Wooden Clog lived at Arnahval. His
sons, Ord and Val were men grown and youths of the
greatest promise. The men blamed Thorodd for allowing
himself to be insulted so greatly by Bi&ouml;rn, and offered
him their aid, if desired, to end his coming. It chanced
one time when Bi&ouml;rn came to Froda, that he sat with
Thurid talking. It was Thorodd's custom when Bi&ouml;rn
was there to sit in the house. But he was now nowhere
to be seen. Then Thurid said, "Take care, Bi&ouml;rn, for I
fear Thorodd means to put a stop to your visits here; I
think he has secured the road, and means to attack you,
and overpower you with unequal numbers." Bi&ouml;rn replied,
"That is possible," and then sang these verses:</p>

<p class="poem">
O Goddess<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> whom bracelet adorns,<br />
This day (I linger<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>In my beloved's arms)<br />
Stay longest in the heavens,<br />
As we both must wish;<br />
For I this night am drawn<br />
To drink myself the parentals<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a><br />
Of my oft-departing joys.<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">Having done this, Bi&ouml;rn took his weapons, and went to
return home. As he went up the hill Digramula, five
men jumped out upon him from their hiding place. These
were Thorodd and two of his men, and the sons of Thoror
Wooden Clog. They attacked Bi&ouml;rn, but he defended
himself bravely and well. The sons of Thoror pressed
him sharply, but he slew them both. Thorodd then fled
with his men, though he himself had only a slight wound,
and the others not any. Bi&ouml;rn went on until he reached
home, and entered the house. The lady of the house<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
ordered a maid to place food before him. When the
maid came into the room with the light, and saw Bi&ouml;rn
wounded, she went and told Asbrand his father, that
Bi&ouml;rn had returned, covered with blood. Asbrand came
into the room, and inquired what was the cause of his
wounds. He said, "Have you and Thorodd had a fight!"
Bi&ouml;rn replied that it was so. Asbrand asked how the
affair ended. Bi&ouml;rn replied with these verses:</p>

<p class="poem">
Not so easy against a brave man<br />
It is to fight;<br />
(Wooden Clog's two sons<br />
Now I have slain).<br />
As for the ship's commander,<br />
A woman to embrace,<br />
Or for the cowardly,<br />
A golden tribute to buy.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p class="noidt">Asbrand bound up his son's wounds, and his strength was
soon restored. Thorodd went to Snorre the Priest, to
talk with him about setting a suit on foot against Bi&ouml;rn,
on account of the killing of Thoror's sons. This suit was
laid in the court of Thorsnesthing. It was settled that
Asbrand, who became surety for his son, should pay the
usual fines. Bi&ouml;rn was exiled for three years,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> and went
abroad the same summer. During that summer, a son
was born to Thurid, who was called Kiarten. He grew
up at home, in Froda, and early gave great hope and
promise.</p>

<p>When Bi&ouml;rn crossed the sea he came into Denmark,
and went thence to Jomsberg. At that time, Palnatoki
was captain of the Jomsberg<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Vikings. Bi&ouml;rn was
admitted into the crew, and won the name of the Athlete.
He was at Jomsberg when Styrbi&ouml;rn the Hardy, assaulted
it. He went into Sweden, when the Jomsberg Vikings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
aided Styrbi&ouml;rn;<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> he was in the battle of Tynsvall, in
which Styrbi&ouml;rn was killed, and escaped with the other
Joms-vikings in the woods. While Palnatoki lived, Bi&ouml;rn
remained with him, distinguished among all, as a man of
remarkable courage.</p>

<p>The same summer [A. D. 996.] the brothers, Bi&ouml;rn and
Arnbi&ouml;rn returned into Iceland to R&ouml;nhavnsos. Bi&ouml;rn
was always afterwards called the Athlete of Breidavik.
Arnbi&ouml;rn, who had gotten much wealth abroad, bought the
Bakka estate in Raunhavn, the same summer. He lived
there with little show or ostentation, and in most affairs
was silent, but was, nevertheless, a man active in all
things. Bi&ouml;rn, his brother, after his return from abroad,
lived in splendor and elegance, for during his absence, he
had truly adopted the manners of courtiers. He much
excelled Arnbi&ouml;rn in personal appearance, and was none
the less active in execution. He was far more expert than
his brother in martial exercises, having improved much
abroad. The same summer after his return, there was a
general meeting near Headbrink,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> within the bay of Froda.
All the merchants rode thither, clothed in colored garments,
and there was a great assembly. Housewife<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Thurid, of Froda, was there, with whom Bi&ouml;rn began to
talk; no one censuring, because they expected their conversation
would be long, as they had not seen each other
for a great while. On the same day there was a fight, and
one of the Nordenfield men was mortally wounded, and was
carried down under a bush on the beach; so much blood
flowed out of the wound, that there was a large pool of
blood in the bush. The boy Kiarten, Thurid of Froda's
son, was there; he had a little axe in his hand, and ran to
the bush and dipped the axe in the blood. When the
Sondensfield's men rode from the beach south, Thord
Blig asked Bi&ouml;rn how the conversation between him and
Thurid of Froda, ended. Bi&ouml;rn said that he was well
satisfied. Then Thord asked if he had seen the boy
Kiarten, their and Thorodd's son. "I saw him," said
Bi&ouml;rn: "What is your opinion of him?" asked Thord.
Bi&ouml;rn answered with the following song:</p>

<p class="poem">
"I saw a boy run<br />
With fearful eyes,<br />
The woman's image, to<br />
The wolf's well<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> in the wood;<br />
People will say,<br />
That his true father [was]<br />
He that ploughed the sea,<br />
This the boy does not know."<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">Thord said: "What will Thorodd say when he hears that
the boy belongs to you?" Then Bi&ouml;rn sung:</p>

<p class="poem">
"Then will the noble born woman [make]<br />
Thorodd's suspicion<br />
Come true, when she gives me<br />
The same kind of sons;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>Always the slender,<br />
Snow-white woman loved me,<br />
I still to her<br />
Am a lover."<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">Thord said, it will he best for you not to have anything
to do with each other, and that you turn your thoughts.
"It is certainly a good idea," said Bi&ouml;rn, "but it is far
from my intention; though there is some difference when
I have to do with such men as her brother Snorre."
"You must take care of your own business," said Thord,
and that ended their talk. Bi&ouml;rn afterwards went home
to Kamb, and took the affairs of the family into his own
hands, for his father was now dead. The following
winter he determined to make a journey over the hills, to
Thurid. Although Thorodd disliked this, he nevertheless
saw that it was not easy to prevent its occurrence, since
before he was defeated by him, and Bi&ouml;rn was much
stronger, and more skilled in arms than before. Therefore
he bribed Thorgrim Galdrakin to raise a snow storm
against Bi&ouml;rn when he crossed the hills. When a day
came, Bi&ouml;rn made a journey to Froda. When he proposed
to return home, the sky was dark and the snow
storm began. When he ascended the hills, the cold
became intense, and the snow fell so thickly that he could
not see his way. Soon the strength of the storm increased
so much that he could hardly walk. His clothes, already
wet through, froze around his body, and he wandered, he
did not know where. In the course of the night he
reached a cave, and in this cold house he passed the night.
Then Bi&ouml;rn sung:</p>

<p class="poem">
"Woman that bringest<br />
Vestments,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> would<br />
Not like my<br />
Dwelling in such a storm<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>If she knew that<br />
He who before steered ships,<br />
Now in the rock cave<br />
Lay stiff and cold."<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">Again he sang:</p>

<p class="poem">
"The cold field of the swans,<br />
From the east with loaded ship I ploughed,<br />
Because the woman inspired me with love;<br />
I know that I have great trouble suffered,<br />
And now, for a time, the hero is,<br />
Not in a woman's bed, but in a cave."<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">Bi&ouml;rn stayed three days in the cave, before the storm
subsided; and on the fourth day he came home from the
mountain to Kamb. He was very weary. The domestic
asked him where he was during the storm. Bi&ouml;rn sung:</p>

<p class="poem">
"My deeds under<br />
Styrbi&ouml;rn's proud banner are known.<br />
It came about that steel-clad Eric<br />
Slew men in battle;<br />
Now I on the wide heath,<br />

</p>

<p class="noidt">Bi&ouml;rn passed the rest of the winter at home; the following
spring his brother Arnbi&ouml;rn fixed his abode in Bakka, in
Raunhafn, but Bi&ouml;rn lived at Kamb, and had a grand
house....</p>

<p>This same summer, Thorodd the Tribute Taker invited
Snorre the Priest, his kinsman, to a feast at his house in
Froda. Snorre went there with twenty men. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
course of the feast, Thorodd told Snorre how much he
was hurt and disgraced by the visits of Bi&ouml;rn Asbrandson,
to Thurid, his wife, Snorre's sister, saying that it was right
for Snorre to do away with this scandal. Snorre after
passing some days feasting with Thorodd went home with
many presents. Then Snorre the Priest rode over the
hills and spread the report that he was going down to his
ship in the bay of Raunhafn. This happened in summer,
in the time of haymaking. When he had gone as far
south as the Kambian hills, Snorre said: "Now let us
ride back from the hills to Kamb; let it be known to you,"
he added, "what I wish to do. I have resolved to attack
and destroy Bi&ouml;rn. But I am not willing to attack and
destroy him in his house, for it is a strong one, and Bi&ouml;rn
is stout and active, while our number is small. Even those
who with greater numbers, have attacked brave men in
their houses, have fared badly; an example of which you
know in the case of Gissur the White; who, when with
eighty men, they attacked Gunnar<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> of Lithend, alone in
his house, many were wounded and many were killed, and
they would have been compelled to give up the attack, if
Geir the Priest had not learned that Gunnar was short of
arrows. Therefore," said he, "as we may expect to find
Bi&ouml;rn out of doors, it being the time of haymaking, I
appoint you my kinsman, Mar, to give him the first
wound; but I would have you know this, that there is no
room for child's play, and you must expect a contest with
a hungry wolf, unless your first wound shall be his death
blow." As they rode from the hills towards his homestead,
they saw Bi&ouml;rn in the fields; he was making a sledge,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
and no one was near him. He had no weapon but a small
axe, and a large knife in his hand of a span's length, which
he used to round the holes in the sledge. Bi&ouml;rn saw
Snorre riding down from the hills, and recognized them.
Snorre the Priest had on a blue cloak, and rode first. The
idea suddenly occurred to Bi&ouml;rn, that he ought to take his
knife and go as fast as he could to meet them, and as
soon as he reached them, lay hold of the sleeve of Snorre
with one hand, and hold the knife in the other, so that he
might be able to pierce Snorre to the heart, if he saw that
his own safety required it. Going to meet them, Bi&ouml;rn
gave them hail; and Snorre returned the salute. The
hands of Mar fell, for he saw that if he attacked Bi&ouml;rn, the
latter would at once kill Snorre. Then Bi&ouml;rn walked
along with Snorre and his comrades, asked what was the
news, keeping his hands as at first. Then he said: "I
will not try to conceal, neighbor Snorre, that my present
attitude and look seem threatening to you, which might
appear wrong, but for that I have understood that your
coming is hostile. Now I desire that if you have any
business to transact with me, you will take another course
than the one you intended, and that you will transact it
openly. If none, I will that you make peace, which when
done, I will return to my work, as I do not wish to be led
about like a fool." Snorre replied: "Our meeting has so
turned out that we shall at this time part in the same
peace as before; but I desire to get a pledge from you,
that from this time you will leave off visiting Thurid,
because if you go on in this, there can never be any real
friendship between us." Bi&ouml;rn replied: "This I will
promise, and will keep it; but I do not know how I shall
be able to keep it, so long as Thurid and I live in the same
land." "There is nothing so great binding you here,"
said Snorre, "as to keep you from going to some other
land." "What you now say is true," replied Bi&ouml;rn, "and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
so let it be, and let our meeting end with this pledge, that
neither you nor Thorodd shall have any trouble from my
visits to Thurid, in the next year." With this they
parted. Snorre the Priest rode down to his ship, and
then went home to Helgefell. The day after, Bi&ouml;rn rode
south to Raunhafn, and engaged his passage in a ship for
the same summer. [A. D. 999.] When all was ready
they set sail with a northeast wind which blew during the
greater part of that summer. Nothing was heard of the
fate of the ship for a very long time.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<h3><a name="III_GUDLEIF_GUDLAUGSON" id="III_GUDLEIF_GUDLAUGSON"></a>III. GUDLEIF GUDLAUGSON.</h3>


<p>This narrative, which shows what became of Bi&ouml;rn
Asbrandson, whose adventures are partially related in the
previous sketch, is from the Eyrbyggia Saga. Notwithstanding
the somewhat romantic character of these two
narratives, there can be no doubt but that they are true
histories. Yet that they relate to events in America, is
not altogether so certain.</p>

<hr class="half" />
<p>There was a man named Gudleif, the son of Gudlaug
the Rich, of Straumfiord and brother of Thorfinn, from
whom the Sturlingers are descended. Gudleif was a great
merchant. He had a trading vessel, and Thorolf Eyrar
Loptson had another, when they fought with Gyrid, son of
Sigvald Earl. Gyrid lost an eye in that fight. It took
place near the end of the reign of King Olaf the Saint, that
Gudleif went on a trading voyage to the west to Dublin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
On his return to Iceland, sailing from the west of Ireland,
he met with northeast winds, and was driven far into the
ocean west, and southwest, so that no land was seen, the
summer being now nearly gone. Many prayers were offered
that they might escape from the sea. At length they saw
land. It was of great extent, but they did not know what
land it was. They took counsel and resolved to make for
the land, thinking it unwise to contend with the violence
of the sea. They found a good harbor, and soon after
they went ashore, a number of men came down to them.
They did not recognize the people, but thought that their
language resembled the Irish.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> In a short time such a
number of men had gathered around them as numbered
many hundred. These attacked them and bound them
all and drove them inland. Afterwards they were brought
before an assembly, and it was considered what should be
done with them. They thought that some wished to kill
and that others were for dividing them among the villages
as slaves. While this was going on, they saw a great
number of men riding<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> towards them with a banner conspicuously
lifted up, whence they inferred that some great
man was among them. And when the company drew
near, they saw a man riding under the banner, tall and
with a martial air, aged and grayhaired. All present
treated this man with the utmost honor and deference.
They soon saw that their case was referred to the decision
of this man. He commanded Gudleif and his comrades
to be brought before him, and coming into his presence
he addressed them in the Northern tongue, and asked from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
what land they came. They replied that the chief part
were Icelanders. The man asked which of them were
Icelanders. Gudleif declared himself to be an Icelander,
and saluted the old man, which he received kindly, and
asked what part of Iceland he came from. He replied
that he came from the district some called Bogafiord.
He asked who lived in Bogafiord, to which Gudleif
replied at some length. Afterwards this man inquired
particularly about all the principal men of Bogafiord and
Breidafiord; and of these he inquired with special interest
into everything relating to Snorre the Priest, and of his
sister Thurid, of Froda, and for the great Kiarten, her son.
In the meanwhile the natives grew impatient about the
disposition of the sailors. Afterwards the great man left
him and took twelve of the natives apart, and conferred
with them. Afterwards he returned. Then the old man
spoke to Gudleif and his comrades, and said: "We have
had some debate concerning you, and the people have left
the matter to my decision; I now permit you to go where
you will, and although summer is nearly gone, I advise you
to leave at once; for these people are of bad faith, and hard
to deal with, and now think they have been deprived of
their right." Then Gudleif asked, "Who shall we say, if
we reach our own country again, to have given us our
liberty?" He replied: "That, I will not tell you, for I
am not willing that any of my friends or kindred should
come here, and meet with such a fate as you would have
met, but for me. Age now comes on so fast, that I may
almost expect any hour to be my last. Though I may
live some time longer, there are other men of greater
influence than myself, though now at some distance from
this place, and these would not grant safety or peace to
any strange men." Then he looked to the fitting out of
their ship, and stayed at this place until a fair wind sprang
up, so that they might leave the port. Before they went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
away, this man took a gold ring from his hand and gave
it to Gudleif, and also a good sword. Then he said to
Gudleif: "If fortune permits you to reach Iceland, give
this sword to Kiarten, hero of Froda, and this ring to
Thurid, his mother." Gudleif asked, "Who shall I say
was the sender of this valuable gift?" He replied: "Say
that he sent it who loved the lady of Froda, better than
her brother, the Priest of Helgafell. And if any man
desires to know who sent this valuable gift, repeat my
words, that I forbid any one to seek me, for it is a dangerous
voyage, unless others should meet with the same
fortune as you. This region is large, but has few good
ports, and danger threatens strangers on all sides from the
people, unless it shall fall to others as yourselves." After
this they separated. Gudleif, with his comrades, went to
sea, and reached Ireland the same autumn, and passed the
winter in Dublin. The next spring they sailed to Iceland,
and Gudleif delivered the jewel into the hand of Thurid.
It was commonly believed that there was no doubt but
that the man seen, was Bi&ouml;rn Breidaviking Kappa. And
there is no other reliable report to prove this.</p>

<p>Professor Rafn, in <i>Antiquitates American&aelig;</i>, gives brief
notices of numerous Icelandic voyages to America, and
other lands at the west, of which there is now no record.
The works in which they are found are of the highest
respectability. It is only necessary here to give the facts,
which have been collected with much care. They show
that the pre-Columbian discovery of America has tinged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
nearly the whole body of Icelandic history, in which the
subject is referred to, not as a matter of doubt, but as
something perfectly well known. All these revelations
combine to furnish indisputable proof of the positions
maintained in this work, showing as they do, beyond all
reasonable question, that the impression which so generally
prevailed in regard to the discovery of this land, was not the
result of a literary fraud. Some of the facts are given
below:</p>

<p>The first of these documents is from a work which professes
to give a description of the earth in the middle age.
From this it appears that the Icelanders had a correct idea
of the location of Vinland in New England, though they
did not comprehend the fact that they had discovered a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>

American&aelig;</i>, p. 283. In the appendix of that work may
be seen a <i>fac simile</i> of the original manuscript. The second
document is from (<i>Antiquitates American&aelig;</i>, p. 292). It was
found originally in the miscellaneous collection called the
<i>Gripla</i>.</p>


<h4>A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE WHOLE EARTH.</h4>

<p>The earth is said to be divided into three parts. One of
these is called Asia, and extends from northeast to southwest,
and occupies the middle of the earth. In the eastern
part are three separate regions, called Indialand. In the
farthest India, the Apostle Bartholomew preached the
faith; and where he likewise gave up his life (for the name
of Christ). In the nearest India, the Apostle Thomas
preached, and there also he suffered death for the cause
of God. In that part of the earth called Asia, is the city
of Nineveh, greatest of all cities. It is three days' journey
in length and one day's journey in breadth. There is also
the city of Babylon, ancient and very large. There King
Nebuchadnezzar formerly reigned, but now that city is so
thoroughly destroyed that it is not inhabited by men, on
account of serpents and all manner of noxious creatures.
In Asia is Jerusalem, and also Antioch; in this city Peter
the Apostle founded an Episcopal seat, and where he, the
first of all men, sang Mass. Asia Minor is a region of
Great Asia. There the Apostle John preached, and there
also, in the city Ephesus, is his tomb. They say that four
rivers flow out of Paradise. One is called Pison or Ganges;
this empties into the sea surrounding the world. Pison
rises under a mountain called Orcobares. The second river
flowing from Paradise, is called Tigris, and the third, Euphrates.
Both empty into the Mediterranean (sea), near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Antioch. The Nile, also called Geon, is the fourth river that
runs from Paradise. It separates Asia from Africa, and flows
through the whole of Egypt. In Egypt is New Babylon
(Cairo), and the city called Alexandria. The second part
of the earth is called Africa, which extends from the southwest
to the northwest. There are Serkland, and three
regions called Blaland (land of blackmen or negroes). The
Mediterranean sea divides Europe from Africa. Europe is
the third part of the earth, extended from west and northwest
to the northeast. In the east of Europe is the kingdom of
Russia. There are Holmgard, Palteskia and Smalenskia.
South of Russia lies the kingdom of Greece. Of this kingdom,
the chief city is Constantinople, which our people call
Miklagard. In Miklagard is a church, which the people
call St. Sophia, but the Northmen call it, &AElig;gisif. This
church exceeds all the other churches in the world, both as
respects its structure and size. Bulgaria and a great many
islands, called the Greek islands, belong to the kingdom
of Greece. Crete and Cyprus are the most noted of the
Greek islands. Sicily is a great kingdom in that part of
the earth called Europe. Italy is a country south of the
great ridge of mountains, called by us Mundia [Alps]. In
the remotest part of Italy is Apulia, called by the Northmen,
Pulsland. In the middle of Italy is Rome. In
the north of Italy is Lombardy, which we call Lombardland.
North of the mountains on the east, is Germany,
and on the southwest is France. Hispania, which we call
Spainland, is a great kingdom that extends south to the
Mediterranean, between Lombardy and France. The
Rhine is a great river that runs north from Mundia,
between Germany and France. Near the outlets of the
Rhine is Friesland, northward from the sea. North of
Germany is Denmark. The ocean runs into the Baltic
sea, near Denmark. Sweden lies east of Denmark, and
Norway at the north. North of Norway is Finnmark.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
The coast bends thence to the northeast, and then towards
the east, until it reaches Permia, which is tributary to
Russia. From Permia, desert tracts extend to the north,
reaching as far as Greenland. Beyond Greenland, southward,
is Helluland; beyond that is Markland; from thence
it is not far to Vinland, which some men are of the opinion,
extends to Africa.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> England and Scotland are one island;
but each is a separate kingdom. Ireland is a great island.
Iceland is also a great island north of Ireland. All these
countries are situated in that part of the world called
Europe. Next to Denmark is Lesser Sweden; then is
Oeland, then Gottland, then Helsingeland, then Vermeland,
and the two Kvendlands, which lie north of Biarmeland.
From Biarmeland stretches desert land towards the
north, until Greenland begins. South of Greenland is
Helluland; next is Markland, from thence it is not far to
Vinland the Good, which some think goes out to Africa;
and if this is so, the sea must extend between Vinland and
Markland. It is told that Thorfinn Karlsefne cut wood
here to ornament his house,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> went afterwards to seek out
Vinland the Good, and came there where they thought
the land was, but did not reach it, and got none of the
wealth of the land.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Leif the Lucky first discovered
Vinland, and then he met some merchants in distress at
sea, and by God's grace, saved their lives; and he introduced
Christianity into Greenland, and it flourished so
there that an Episcopal seat was set up in the place, called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Gardar. England and Scotland are an island, and yet
each is a separate kingdom. Ireland is a great island.
These countries are all in that part of the world called
Europe.</p>


<h4>FROM GRIPLA.</h4>

<p>Bavaria is bounded by Saxony; Saxony is bounded by
Holstein, and next is Denmark. The sea runs between
the eastern countries. Sweden is east of Denmark. Norway
is to the north; Finmark is east of Norway; from
thence the land extends to the northeast and east, until
you come to Biarmeland; this land is under tribute to
Gardaridge. From Biarmeland lie desert places all northward
to the land which is called Greenland, [which, however,
the Greenlanders do not affirm, but believe to have
seen it otherwise, both from drift timber, that is known
and cut down by men, and also from reindeer which have
marks upon their ears, or bands upon their horns, likewise
from sheep which stray here, of which there are
some remaining in Norway, for one head hangs in Throndheim,
and another in Bergen, and many others are to be
found.]<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> But there are bays, and the land stretches out
towards the southwest; there are ice mountains, and
bays, and islands lie out in front of the ice mountains; one
of the ice mountains cannot be explored, and the other is
half a month's sail, to the third, a week's sail. This is
nearest to the settlement called Hvidserk. Thence the
land trends north; but he who desires to go by the settlement,
steers to the southwest. Gardar, the bishop's seat,
is at the bottom of Ericsfiord; there is a church consecrated
to holy Nicholas. There are twelve churches in the
eastern settlement, and four in the western.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it should be told what is opposite Greenland, out
from the bay, which was before named. Furdustrandur<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
is the name of the land; the cold is so severe that it is not
habitable, so far as is known. South from thence is
Helluland, which is called Skr&aelig;llings land. Thence it is
not far to Vinland the Good, which some think goes out
to Africa.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Between Vinland and Greenland, is Ginnungagah,
which runs from the sea called <i>Mare Oceanum</i>, and
surrounds the whole earth.</p>

sight of for a period of thirteen hundred years. In the reign of Edward
III of England, at the beginning of the fourteenth century, one Robert
Machin sailed from Bristol for France, carrying away a lady of rank, who
had eloped with him, and was driven by a storm to the Canaries, where he
landed, and thus rediscovered the lost Fortunate Isles. This fact is curiously
established by Major, in the <i>Life of Prince Henry</i>, so that it can no
longer be regarded as an idle tale (see pp. 66-77). In 1341, a voyage was
also made to the Canaries, under the auspices of King Henry of Portugal.
The report, so widely circulated by De Barros, that the islands were
rediscovered by Prince Henry is therefore incorrect. His expedition
reached Porto Santo and Madeira in 1418-20.</p></div>

planking the ship, "it happened that Thorberg had to go home to his
farm upon some urgent business; and as he stayed there a long time, the
ship was planked upon both sides when he came back. In the evening the
king went out and Thorberg with him, to see how the ship looked, and all
said that never was seen so large and fine a ship of war. Then the king
went back to the town. Early the next morning the king came back
again to the ship, and Thorberg with him. The carpenters were there
before them, but all were standing idle with their hands across. The king
asked, 'What is the matter?' They said the ship was ruined; for somebody
had gone from stem to stern, and cut one deep notch after another
down the one side of the planking. When the king came nearer he saw
that it was so, and said with an oath, 'The man shall die who has thus
ruined the ship out of malice, if he can be found, and I will give a great
reward to him who finds him out.' 'I can tell you, king,' says Thorberg,
'who has done this piece of work.' 'I don't think that any one is so likely
to find it out as thou art.' Thorberg says: 'I will tell you, king, who did
it, I did it myself.' The king says, 'Thou must restore it all to the same
condition as before, or thy life shall pay for it.' Then Thorberg went and
chipped the planks until the deep notches were all smoothed and made
even with the rest; and the king and all present declared that the ship
was much handsomer on the side of the hull which Thorberg had chipped,
and bade him shape the other side in the same way and gave him great
thanks for the improvement."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> A few years ago two very ancient vessels which probably belonged to
the seventh century were exhumed on the coast of Denmark, seven thousand
feet from the sea, where they were scuttled and sunk. The changes
in the coast finally left them imbedded in the sand. One vessel was
seventy-two feet long, and nine feet wide amid ships. The other was
forty-two feet long, and contained two eight-sided spars, twenty-four feet
long. The bottoms were covered with mats of withes for the purpose
of keeping them dry. Among the contents was a Damascened sword, with
runes, showing that the letter existed among the Northmen in the seventh
century.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55_55" id="Footnote_55_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> The people of Iceland were always noted for their superiority in this
respect over their kinsmen in Denmark and Norway. There is one significant
fact bearing on this point, which is this: that, while a few of the
people of Iceland went at an early period to engage in piratical excursions
with the vikings of Norway, not a single pirate ship ever sailed from
Iceland. Such ways were condemned altogether at an early day, while
various European nations continued to sanction piracy down to recent periods.
Again it should be remembered that in Iceland duelling was also solemnly
declared illegal as early as 1011, and in Norway the following year; while
in England it did not cease to be a part of the judicial process until 1818.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_56_56" id="Footnote_56_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_56"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> Those who imagine that these manuscripts, while of pre-Columbian
origin, have been tampered with and interpolated, show that they have not
the faintest conception of the state of the question. The accounts of the
voyages of the Northmen to America form the <i>framework</i> of Sagas
which would actually be destroyed by the elimination of the narratives.
There is only one question to be decided, and that is the <i>date</i> of these
compositions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_57_57" id="Footnote_57_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57_57"><span class="label">[57]</span></a> The fact that Mr. Bancroft has in times past expressed opinions in
opposition to this view will hardly have weight with those persons familiar
with the subject. When that writer composed the first chapter of his
<i>History of the United States</i>, he might have been excused for setting down
the Icelandic narratives as shadowy fables; but, with all the knowledge
shed upon the subject at present, we have a right to look for something
better. It is therefore unsatisfactory to find him perpetuating his early
views in each successive edition of the work, which show the same knowledge
of the subject betrayed at the beginning. He tells us that these
voyages "rest on narratives <i>mythological</i> in form, and <i>obscure</i> in meaning,"
which certainly cannot be the case. Furthermore they are "not contemporary;"
which is true, even with regard to Mr. Bancroft's <i>own</i> work. Again,
"The chief document is an interpolation in the history of Sturleson." This
cannot be true in the sense intended, for Mr. Bancroft conveys the idea that
the principal narrative <i>first</i> appeared in Sturleson's history when published
at a <i>late day</i>. It is indeed well known that one version, but <i>not</i> the
principal version, was interpolated in Peringskiold's edition of Sturleson's
<i>Heimskringla</i>, printed at Copenhagen. But Bancroft teaches that these
relations are of a modern date, while it is well known that they were taken
<i>verbatim</i> from <i>Codex Flat&ouml;iensis</i>, finished in the year 1395. He is much
mistaken in supposing that the northern Antiquarians think any more
highly of the narratives in question, because they once happened to be
printed in connection with Sturleson's great work. He tells us that Sturleson
"could hardly have neglected the discovery of a continent," if such an
event had taken place. But this, it should be remembered, depends upon
<i>whether or not the discovery was considered of any particular importance</i>.
This does <i>not</i> appear to have been the case. The fact is nowhere dwelt upon
for the purpose of exalting the actors. Besides, as Laing well observes,
the discovery of land at the west had nothing to do with his subject, which
was the history of the kings of Norway. The discovery of America gave
rise to a little traffic, and nothing more. Moreover the kings of Norway
took no part, <i>were not the patrons of the navigators</i>, and <i>had no influence
whatever in instituting a single voyage</i>. Mr. Bancroft's last objection is
that Vinland, the place discovered, "has been sought in all directions from
Greenland and the St. Lawrence to Africa." This paragraph also conveys
a false view of the subject, since the location of Vinland was as
well known to the Northmen as the situation of Ireland, with which island
they had uninterrupted communication. It is to be earnestly hoped that
in the next edition, Mr. Bancroft may be persuaded to revise his unfounded
opinions.
</p><p>
Washington Irving has expressed the same doubt in his Life of Columbus,
<i>written before the means of examining this question were placed within
his reach</i>, and in the appendix of his work he mixes the idle tales of St.
Brandan's Isle with the authentic histories of the Northmen. A very
limited inquiry would have led him to a different estimate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_58_58" id="Footnote_58_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> The word rune comes from <i>ryn</i>, a furrow. Odin has the credit of the
invention, yet they are probably of Phenician origin. They were sometimes
used for poetical purposes. Halmund, in the Grettir Saga (see Sabing
Baring Gould's <i>Iceland</i>), says to his daughter: "Thou shalt now listen
whilst I relate my deeds, and sing thereof a song, which thou shalt afterwards
cut upon a staff." This indicates the training the memory must have
undergone among the Northmen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_62_62" id="Footnote_62_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62_62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> As early as 1411, there was a considerable trade between Bristol and
Iceland, and Columbus visited Iceland in the spring of the year 1477, where
he <i>might</i> have met Magnus Eyolfson, the bishop of Skalholt, or learned
from some other scholar the facts in relation to the early Icelandic discoveries.
Though Rafn supposes that by his visit, his opinions, previously
formed regarding the existence of the Western continent, were confirmed,
this is not altogether clear, for the reason that Columbus was not seeking
a new continent, but a route to the Indies, which he believed he should
find by sailing west. Accordingly when he found land he called it the
<i>West</i> Indies, supposing that he had reached the extreme boundary of the
<i>East</i> Indies. Irving tells us that Columbus founded his theory on (1), the
nature of things; (2), the authority of learned writers; (3), the reports of
navigators.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_63_63" id="Footnote_63_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> Adam of Bremen even heard of the exploits of the Northmen in Vinland,
and made mention of that country. But as it <i>might</i> be said that his
work did not appear until after the voyage of Columbus, and that the
reference may be an interpolation, the author does not rest anything upon
it. Still he unquestionably knew of the voyages of the Northmen, as he
lived near the time they were made, and wrote his ecclesiastical history in
about the year 1075, after he had made a visit to King Sweno of Denmark,
and had accumulated much material. The passage in question is as
follows: "Besides, it was stated [by the king] that a region had been discovered
by many in that [the western] ocean, which was called Winland,
because vines grow there spontaneously, making excellent wine; for that
fruits, not planted, grow there of their own accord, we know not by false
rumor, but by the certain testimony of the Danes."
</p><p>
The very ancient Faroese ballad of Finn the Handsome (see Rafn's <i>Antiquitates
American&aelig;</i>, p. 319), also contains references to Vinland, which
indicates that the country was known as well by the Irish as by the
Icelanders.</p></div>

colony of St. Savion, established on the coast of Maine, by Saussaye, in

miles south of Taunton, Mass., on the east side of Taunton river, formed by
Assonnet Neck. It lies in the edge of the river, and is left dry at low water.
It is a boulder of fire graywack, twelve feet long and five feet high, and
faces the bed of the river. Its front is now covered with chiseled inscriptions
of what appear to be letters and outlines of men, animals and birds.
As early as the year 1680, Dr. Danforth secured a drawing of the upper
portion; Cotton Mather made a full copy in 1712; and in 1788, Professor
Winthrop, of Harvard College, took a full-sized impression on prepared
paper. Various other copies have been made at different times, all of
which present substantially the same features. Yet in the interpretation
of the inscription there has been little agreement. The old rock is a
riddle, dumb as the Sphinx. A copy of the inscription was shown to a
Mohawk chief, who decided that it was nothing less than the representation
of a triumph by Indians over a wild beast which took place on this
spot. Mr. Schoolcraft also showed a copy to Chingwank, an Algonquin
well versed in picture-writing, who gave a similar interpretation. The
Roman characters in the central part of the composition he was finally
induced to reject, as having no connection with the rest. And whoever
compares this inscription with those of undeniably Indian origin found
elsewhere, cannot fail to be impressed with the similarity. Nevertheless,
members of the Royal Society of Antiquarians, to whose notice it was
brought by the Rhode Island Historical Society, felt strongly persuaded
that the rock bears evidence of the Northman's visit to these shores. Mr.
Laing, the accomplished translator of the <i>Heimskringla</i>, in discussing the
theories in regard to the inscription, says, that the only real resemblance to
letters is found in the middle of the stone, in which antiquarians discover
the name of Thorfinn, that is, Thorfinn Karlsefne, the leader of the expedition
which came to New England in 1007. Just over these letters is a
character supposed to be Roman also, which may signify NA, or MA,
the letter A being formed by the last branch of M. Now MA in Icelandic
is used as an abbreviation of <i>Madr</i>, which signifies the original settler of a
country. Close to these two letters are several numerals, construed to
mean <i>one hundred and fifty-one</i>. And according to the account of the
voyage, Thorfinn lost <i>nine</i> of the hundred and sixty men with whom it is
presumed he started, and therefore <i>one hundred and fifty-one</i> would exactly
express the number with him at the time he is supposed to have cut the
inscription. This, then, would mean altogether, that Thorfinn Karlsefne
established himself here with one hundred and fifty-one men. Yet, as the
testimony of this rock is not needed, we may readily forego any advantage
that can be derived from its study. Besides, the history of similar cases
should serve to temper our zeal. In the time of Saxo Grammatticus (1160),
there was a stone at Hoby, near Runamoe, in the Swedish province of
Bleking, which was supposed to be sculptured with runes. At a late day
copies were furnished the antiquarians, who came to the conclusion, as
Laing tells us, that it was a genuine inscription, referring to the battle of
Braaville, fought in the year 680. It afterwards turned out that the apparent
inscription was made by the disintegration of veins of a soft material
existing in the rock. Yet the Dighton inscription is beyond question the
work of man. Mr. A. E. Kendal, writing in 1807, says that there was a
tradition that Assonnet Neck, on which tongue of land the rock is situated,
was once a place of banishment among the Indians. He states, further,
that the Indians had a tradition to the effect, that in ancient times some
<i>white</i> men in a <i>bird</i> landed there and were slaughtered by the aborigines.
They also said thunder and lightening issued from the bird, which fact
indicates that this event, if it occurred at all, must be referred to the age
of gunpowder. Mr. Kendal mentions the story of a ship's anchor having
been found there at an early day. In former years the rock was frequently
dug under by the people, in the hope of finding concealed treasures. It
is said that a small rock once existed near by which also bore marks of
human hands. The Portsmouth and Tiverton Rocks, described by Mr. Webb
(<i>Antiquitates American&aelig;</i>, pp. 355-71), are doubtless Indian inscriptions;
while that on the island of Monhegan, off the coast of Maine, may perhaps
be classed with the rock of Hoby. Yet after all, it is possible that the <i>central</i>
portion of the inscription on the Dighton Rock, may be the work of the
Northmen. That two distinct parties were concerned in making the
inscription is clear from the testimony of the Indians, who did not pretend to
understand the portion thought to refer to Karlsefne. For the full discussion,
see <i>Antiquitates American&aelig;</i>, p. 378, <i>et seq.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_68_68" id="Footnote_68_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68_68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> The Old Mill at Newport stands on an eminence in the centre of the
town, being about twenty-four feet high, and twenty-three feet in diameter.
It rests upon eight piers and arches. It has four small windows, and, high
up the wall, above the arches, was a small fire place. It is first distinctly
mentioned in the will of Governor Benedict Arnold, of Newport, where it
is called, "my stone-built wind mill." It is known that during the
eighteenth century it served both as a mill and powder house. Edward Pelham,
who married Governor Arnold's granddaughter, in 1740 also called it
"an old stone mill." Peter Easton, who early went to live in Newport, wrote
in 1663, that "this year we built the first windmill;" and August 28, 1675,
he says, "A storm blew down our windmill." What Easton relates occurred
before Governor Arnold writes about his stone windmill, and it is not unreasonable
to suppose that when the one spoken of by Easton was destroyed he
built something more substantial. Yet we cannot say that this was actually
the case. The old tower existing at the beginning of the settlement may
have been adapted by him for the purposes of a mill, when the one mentioned
by Easton was destroyed.
</p><p>
The family of the Governor is said to have come from Warwickshire, England,
and one of his farms was called the Leamington farm, as is supposed,
from the place by that name near Warwick. In addition to this, in the
Chesterton Parish, three miles from Leamington, there is an old windmill
similar in construction to that at Newport. It is supposed that it was
erected on pillars for pneumatic reasons, and also that carts might thus
go underneath and be loaded and unloaded with greater ease. And
it has been suggested, that <i>if</i> Gov. Arnold came from Warwickshire, of
which the proof is not given, and <i>if</i> the Chesterton Mill was standing
at the time of his departure for New England, he might have built a mill
at Newport after the same model. Yet this is something we know little
about. And whence came the Chesterton Mill itself? There was a <i>tradition</i>
that it was built after a design by Inigo Jones, but this is only a
tradition. That structure also might have belonged to the class of Round
Towers in Ireland, of which one at least was built by Northmen. All is
therefore, in a measure, doubtful. It will hardly help the Northmen to
class this Newport relic with their works. See Palfrey's <i>New England</i>,
vol. <span class="smcap">i</span>, pp. 57-9.</p></div>

River, was a relic of the Northmen, and one of those men killed by the
natives in the battle with Karlsefne. But it would be far more reasonable
to look for traces of the Northmen among the Indians of Gaspe,
who, at an early day, were distinguished for an unusual degree of civilization.
Malte Brun tells us that they worshiped the sun, knew the
points of the compass, observed the position of some of the stars, and
traced maps of their country. Before the French missionaries went among
them they worshiped the figure of the Cross, and had a tradition that
a venerable person once visited them, and during an epidemic cured
many by the use of that symbol. See Malte Brun's <i>Geography</i> (English
edition), vol. <span class="smcap">v</span>, p. 135. Malte Brun's authority is Father Leclerc's

out from Reikiavek, and twelve miles south of Garde in Greenland, yet
they cannot now be found. It is not too much to suppose that they have
been sunk by some of those fearful convulsions which have taken place in
Iceland; yet it is quite as reasonable to conclude that these rocks were
located elsewhere, probably nearer the east coast, which was formerly
more accessible than now. In the version of the Account of Greenland, by
Ivar Bardason (see <i>Antiquitates American&aelig;</i>, p. 301), given from a <i>Faroese

</p><p>
"<i>Item</i>, men shall know, that, between <i>Island</i> and <i>Greenland</i>, lyeth a

Icelanders who were sailing to Greenland. The place of concealment
appears to have been an excavation covered with stone or wood. That the
people were sometimes accustomed to hide money in this way, is evident.
We read in the Saga of Eric the Red, that this person at first intended to
go with his son, Leif, on his voyage to discover the land seen by Heriulf,
and which Leif named Vinland. On his way to the ship, Eric's horse
stumbled, and he fell to the ground seriously injured, and was obliged to
abandon the voyage. He accepted this as a judgment for having, as one
preparation for his absence, buried his money, where his wife, Thorhild,
would not be able to find it.</p></div>

indications that the climate of that region has become more rigorous than
formerly. The fact that water did not freeze, indicates mild weather, which
we might infer from the rigging of their vessels, and the preparation for
sea. In regard to the term Goe, <i>Gr&ouml;nland's Historiske Mindesm&aelig;rker</i>

live in, might at first lead some to suppose that the place contained a forest
or more or less trees, to supply wood. Yet this does not follow, as drift
wood might supply all their wants for building purposes, where they could
not obtain or use stone. Regarding drift wood, Crantz says, in speaking of
Greenland: "For as He has denied this frigid, rocky region the growth of
trees, He has bid the storms of the ocean to convey to its shores a great
deal of wood, which accordingly comes floating thither, part without ice,
but the most part along with it, and lodges itself between the islands.
Were it not for this, we Europeans should have no wood to burn there....
Among this wood are great trees torn up by the roots, which by driving
up and down for many years, and dashing and rubbing on the ice, are quite
bare of branches. A small part of this drift wood are willows, alder and
birch trees, which come out of the bays in the south; also large trunks of
aspen trees, ... but the greatest part is pine and fir. We find also, a good
deal of a sort of wood, finely veined, and with few branches; this, I fancy, is
larchwood.... There is also a solid, reddish wood of a more agreeable
fragrancy than the common fir, with visible cross veins, which I take to be
the same species as the beautiful silver firs, or zirbel, that have the smell
of cedar, and grow on the high Grison hills, and the Switzers wainscot
their rooms with them."&mdash;<i>History of Greenland</i>, vol. <span class="smcap">i</span>, p. 37.</p></div>

features. The following from the <i>Saga of Gisli the Outlaw</i>, shows the
relation that slaves held to freemen. We read, that on one occasion, Gisli
had borrowed a famous sword of Koll, and the latter asked to have it
back, but Gisli in reply asks if he will sell it, receiving a negative reply.
Then he says: "I will give thee thy freedom and goods, so that thou
mayest fare whither thou wilt with other men." This is also declined,
when Gisli continues: "Then I will give thee thy freedom, and lease, or
give thee land, and besides I will give thee sheep, and cattle and goods, as
much as thou needest." This he also declines, and Kol, when Gisli asks
him to name a price, offering any sum of money, besides his freedom, and
"a becoming match, if thou hast a liking for any one." But Kol refused to
sell it at any price, which refusal led to a fight, and in the first onset, the
slave's axe sank into Gisli's brain, while the disputed sword, Graysteel, clove
the thick skull of Kol. See the <i>Saga of Gisli the Outlaw</i>, p, 6, Edinburgh,
1866. Also the Saga of Eric Red, where Thorbiorn thinks it an indignity
that Einar should ask for the hand of his daughter in marriage, Einar being
the son of a slave.</p></div>

be any better foundation for this motion of the Hafgerdingar than of the old

territory which stretches between Massachusetts and Newfoundland, for
there is no other land to answer the description. Of course, no particular

accounts, because cattle and sheep, and sometimes horses, are mentioned in
connection with Greenland. Some have supposed that, for these reasons,
the Saga must be incorrect. Yet, in more modern times, there has been
nothing to prevent the people from keeping such animals, though it has
been found better to substitute dogs for horses. Crantz says, that in "the
year 1759, one of our missionaries brought three sheep with him from
Denmark to New Herrnhuth. These have so increased by bringing some
two, some three lambs a year, that they have been able to kill some every
year since, to send some to Lichtenfels, for a beginning there, and, after all,
to winter ten at present. We may judge how vastly sweet and nutritive
the grass is here, from the following tokens: that tho' three lambs come
from one ewe, they are larger, even in autumn, than a sheep of a year old
in Germany." He says that in the summer they could pasture two hundred
sheep around New Herrnhuth; and that they formerly kept cows,
but that it proved too much trouble.&mdash;<i>History of Greenland</i>, vol. <span class="smcap">i</span>, p. 74.</p></div>

fact, that in early times an island existed northward from Nantucket, on
the opposite coast of Cape Cod. This island, together with a large point of
land which now has also disappeared, existed in the times of Gosnold, who
sailed around Cape Cod, in 1602. The position of this island, together with
the point of land, is delineated in the map given in the Appendix. At one
time, some doubt existed in regard to the truthfulness of the accounts, for
the reason that those portions of land described, no longer existed. Yet
their positions were laid down with scientific accuracy; the outer portion
of the island being called Point Care, while the other point was called Point
Gilbert. Neither Archer nor Brereton in their accounts of Gosnold's voyage,
give the name of the island; but Captain John Smith, in 1614, calls it "Isle
Nawset." Smith's <i>History of Virginia</i>, vol. <span class="smcap">ii</span>, p. 183. This island was of
the drift formation, and as late as half a century ago, a portion of it still
remained, being called Slut Bush. The subject has been very carefully
gone into by Mr. Otis, in his pamphlet on the <i>Discovery of an Ancient Ship
on Cape Cod</i>. Professor Agassiz, writing December 17, 1863, says: "Surprising
and perhaps incredible as the statements of Mr. Amos Otis may
<i>appear</i>, they are nevertheless the direct and natural inference of the observations
which may be easily made along the eastern coast of Cape Cod. Having
of late felt a special interest in the geological structure of that remarkable
region, I have repeatedly visited it during the past summer, and, in company
with Mr. Otis, examined, on one occasion, with the most minute care,
the evidence of the former existence of Isle Nauset and Point Gilbert. I
found it as satisfactory as any geological evidence can be. Besides its
scientific interest," he adds, "this result has some historical importance. At
all events it fully vindicates Archer's account of the aspect of Cape Cod, at
the time of its discovery in 1602, and shows him to have been a truthful
and accurate observer." But possibly the vindication may extend back even
to the Northmen, whom the learned professor and his colaborers did not
have in mind; especially as this discovery will help very materially to
explain their descriptions. Now, in the first account of Thorfinn Karlsefne's
passage around this part of the Vinland, it is said that they called the shore
<i>Wonder-strand</i>, "because they were so long going by," Yet any one in
sailing past the coast to-day will not be struck with its length. But by
glancing at the reconstructed map of Cape Cod (see Appendix), the reader
will find that the coast line is greatly increased, so that in order to pass
around the cape, the navigator must sail a long distance; and, comparing
this distance travelled with the distance actually gained, the Northmen
might well grow weary, and call it Wonder-strand. This quite relieves the
difficulty that was felt by Professor Rafn, who labored to show that the
island in question was Nantucket, notwithstanding the fact that it lay too
far east. For a fuller knowledge of Isle Nauset, see <i>New England Historic
and Genealogical Register</i>, vol. <span class="smcap">xviii</span>, p. 37; and <i>Massachusetts
Historical Collections</i>, vol. <span class="smcap">viii</span>, series <span class="smcap">iii</span>, pp. 72-93.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_104_104" id="Footnote_104_104"></a><a href="#FNanchor_104_104"><span class="label">[104]</span></a> In speaking of the immediate vicinity of <i>Wonder-strand</i>, the second
account of Thorfinn's expedition says, "There were places without harbors,"
which has always been the case, this coast being dangerous; yet
it is said above that "they landed to wait for good weather." This would
be impracticable <i>now</i>, except at Chatham; yet at that day, notwithstanding
the absence of harbors, they would find accommodation for their small
vessel somewhere between the island and the mainland. From Bradford's
<i>History</i>, p. 217, we learn that in 1626-7, there was at this place "a
small blind harbore" that "lyes aboute y<sup>e</sup> middle of Manamoyake Bay,"
which to-day is filled up by recently formed sandy wastes and salt meadows.
This "blind harbore," had at its mouth a treacherous bar of sand. If this
harbor had existed in the days of the Northmen, they would not of
necessity discover it; and hence while Leif might have landed here and
found protection, Thorfinn, in his much larger ship, might have found it
needful to anchor, as he appears to have done, in the grounds between
Isle Nauset and Point Gilbert, while explorations were being made on the
land.</p></div>

cape which existed in Gosnold's day, and which he named Point Gilbert.
The author does not agree with Professor Rafn, in making this point to be
at the eastern entrance to Buzzard's bay. If he had known of the existence
of the Isle Nauset, he would not have looked for the ness in that neighborhood.
At that time Cape Malabar probably did not exist, as we know how
rapidly land is formed in that vicinity; yet it would not have attracted
notice in comparison with the great broad point mentioned by Archer.</p></div>

expedition, meant to convey the idea that there was no frost, compared with
what was experienced in Greenland and Iceland. The early narrator of the
voyage unquestionably tried to make a good impression as regards the
climate. In so doing, he has been followed by nearly all who have come
after him. Eric the Red told some almost fabulous stories about the
climate of Greenland; and yet, because his accounts do not agree with facts,
who is so foolish as to deny that he ever saw Greenland? And with as
much reason we might deny that Leif came to Vinland. With equal reason,
too, we might deny that Morton played the rioter at Merry Mount; for he
tells us in his <i>New English Canaan</i>, that coughs and colds are unknown
in New England. Lieutenant Governor Dudley of Massachusetts complained
of these false representations in his day.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_115_115" id="Footnote_115_115"></a><a href="#FNanchor_115_115"><span class="label">[115]</span></a> This passage was misunderstood by Torf&aelig;us, the earliest writer who
inquired into these questions, and he was followed by Peringskiold, Malte-Brun
and others, who, by their reckoning, made the latitude of Vinland
somewhere near Nova Scotia. Yet the recent studies of Rafn and Finn
Magnussen, have elucidated the point: "The Northmen divided the
heavens or horizons, into eight principal divisions, and the times of the
day according to the sun's apparent motion through these divisions, the
passage through each of which they supposed to occupy a period of three
hours. The day was therefore divided into portions of time corresponding
with these eight divisions, each of which was called an <i>eykt</i>, signifying an
eighth part. This <i>eykt</i> was again divided, like each of the grand divisions
of the heavens, into two smaller and equal portions, called <i>stund</i> or <i>mal</i>.
In order to determine these divisions of time, the inhabitant of each place
carefully observed the diurnal course of the sun, and noted the terrestrial
objects over which it seemed to stand. Such an object, whether artificial
or natural, was called by the Icelanders, <i>dagsmark</i> (daymark). They were
also led to make these daymarks by a division of the horizon according to
the principal winds, as well as by the wants of their domestic economy.
The shepherd's rising time, for instance, was called <i>Hirdis rism&aacute;l</i>, which
corresponds with half-past four o'clock <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, and this was the beginning
of the natural day of twenty-four hours. Reckoning from <i>Hirdis rism&aacute;l</i>
the eight <i>stund</i> or eighth half <i>eykt</i> ended at just half-past four <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>; and
therefore this particular period was called
&#1008;&#945;&#964;&#8127; &#949;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#942;&#957;,
<span class="smcap">eykt</span>. This <i>eykt</i>,
strictly speaking, commenced at three o'clock <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, and ended at half-past
four <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, when it was said to be in <i>eyktarstadr</i> or the termination of the
<i>eykt</i>. The precise moment that the sun appeared in this place indicated the
termination of the artificial day (<i>dagr</i>), and half the natural day (<i>dagr</i>),
and was therefore held especially deserving of notice: the hours of labor,
also, are supposed to have ended at this time. Six o'clock <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> was called
<i>midr morgun</i>; half-past seven <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, <i>Dagmal</i>; nine <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, <i>Dagverdarmal</i>.
Winter was considered to commence in Iceland about the seventeenth of
October, and Bishop Thorlacius, the calculator of the astronomical calendar,
fixes sun-rise in the south of Iceland, on the seventeenth of October,
at half past seven <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> At this hour, according to the Saga, it rose in
Vinland on the shortest day, and set at half-past four <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, which data
fix the latitude of the place at 41&deg; 43&acute; 10&acute;&acute;, being nearly that of Mount Hope
Bay." See <i>Mem. Antiq. du Nord</i>, 1836-7, p. 165. Rafn's calculation makes
the position 41&deg; 24&acute; 10&acute;&acute;. It is based on the view that the observation was
made in Vinland when only the upper portion of the disc had appeared
above the horizon. The difference, of course, is not important. Thus we
know the position of the Icelandic settlement in New England. See
<i>Antiquitates American&aelig;</i>, p. 436.</p></div>

were sent to be trained up in the families of trusty friends. This was done
to preserve the family line. Often, in some bloody feud, a whole household
would be destroyed; yet the children being out at foster, would be preserved,
and in due time come to represent the family. In Leif's day,
heathenism and lawlessness were on the decline. We have a true picture
given us by Dasent, of the way in which children were treated in the
heathen age.
</p><p>
He says: "With us, an old house can stand upon a crooked, as well as
upon a straight support. But in Iceland, in the tenth century, as in all the
branches of that great family, it was only healthy children that were
allowed to live. The deformed, as a burden to themselves, their friends,
and to society, were consigned to destruction by exposure to the violence
of the elements. This was the father's stern right, and, though the mothers
of that age were generally blessed with robust offspring, still the right
was often exercised. As soon as it was born, the infant was laid
upon the bare ground, and, until the father came and looked at it, heard
and saw that it was strong in lung and limb, took it up in his arms, and
handed it over to the nurse; its fate hung in the balance, and life or death
depended upon the sentence of its sire. That danger over, it was duly
washed, signed with the Thunderer's [Thor's] holy hammer&mdash;the symbol of
all manliness and strength&mdash;and solemnly received into the family as the
faithful champion of the ancient gods. When it came to be named, there
was what we should call the christening ale. There was saddling,
mounting and riding among kith and kin. Cousins came in bands from all
points of the compass: dependents, freedmen and thralls all mustered
strong. The ale is broached, the board is set, and the benches are thronged
with guests; the mirth and revelry are at the highest, when in strides into
the hall, a being of awful power, in whom that simple age set full faith.
This was the Norne, the wandering prophetess, sybil, fortune teller, a
woman to whom it was given to know the weirds of men, and who had
come to do honor to the child, and tell his fortune.... After the child was
named, he was often put out to foster with some neighbor, his father's inferior
in power, and there he grew up with the children of the house, and
contracted those friendships and affections which were reckoned better and
more binding than the ties of blood."&mdash;<i>Antiquaires du Nord</i>, 1859, pp. 8-9.</p></div>

have absurdly supposed. In this far off land he found grapes, which powerfully
reminded him of his native country, and the association of ideas is so
strong, that when he first meets Leif, he breaks out in the language of his
childhood, and, like ordinary epicures, expresses his joy, which is all the
more marked on account of his grotesque appearance. Is not this a stroke of
genuine nature, something that a writer, framing the account of a fictitious
voyage, would not dream of?</p></div>

supplemented by the following statement: "There was also self-sown
wheat in the fields, and a tree which is called massur. Of all these they
took samples; and some of the trees were so large that they were used
in houses." It is thought that the massur wood was a species of maple.
Others have declared that it must have been mahogany, and that therefore
the account of Leif's discovery is false. They forget that even George
Popham, in writing home to his patron from Sagadahoc, in 1607, says that
among the productions of the country are "nutmegs and cinnamon." Yet
shall we infer from this that Popham never saw New England?</p></div>

such case will be impartially pointed out. The treatment of this passage
by Smith, in his <i>Dialogues on the Northmen</i>, p. 127, is far from being
candid. He translates the passage thus: "But Eric the Red had died
without professing Christianity," and refers the English reader to the Saga
of Thorfinn Karlsefne, <i>Antiquitates American&aelig;</i>, pp. 119-20, as if he would
there find a reason for his rendering of the text, which is unequivocal, and
is translated literally above. On turning to the authority in question, we
find nothing more said than that "Eric was slow to give up his [pagan]
religion," and that the affair caused a separation between him and his
wife. That he was <i>slow</i> to give up his pagan belief, would seem to indicate
that he <i>did</i> give it up eventually. Moreover, we have the direct

remember that all history is more or less pervaded by similar stories. The
Rev. Cotton, Mather, in his <i>Magnalia of New England</i>, gives the account of
a great number of supernatural events of no better character than this
related in the Saga. Some are ludicrous in the extreme, and others are
horrible, both in their inception and end. Among other stories, is that of
Mr. Philip Smith, deacon of the church at Hadley, Mass., and a member
of the General Court, who appears to have been bewitched. He was finally
obliged to keep his bed. Then it is said that the people "beheld fire sometimes
on the bed; and when the beholders began to discourse of it, it vanished
away. Divers people actually felt something often stir in the bed,
at a considerable distance from the man; it seemed as big as a cat, but
they could never grasp it. Several trying to lean on the bed's head, tho'
the sick man lay wholly still, the bed would shake so as to knock their
heads uncomfortably. A very strong man could not lift the sick man, to
make him lie more easily, tho' he apply'd his utmost strength unto it; and
yet he could go presently and lift the bedstead and a bed, and a man lying
on it, without any strain to himself at all. Mr. Smith dies.... After the
<i>opinion</i> of all had <i>pronounc'd</i> him dead, his countenance continued as
lively as though he had been alive.... Divers noises were heard in the
room where the corpse lay; as the clattering of chairs and stools, whereof
no account could be given."&mdash;<i>Magnalia</i>, ed. 1853, vol. <span class="smcap">i</span>, p. 455. The
account is vouched for by the author, who was one of the most learned
divines of his day. Another is given, among the multitude of which he
had the most convincing proof. He writes: "It was on the second day of
May, in the year 1687, that a most ingenious, accomplish'd and well-dispos'd
young gentleman, Mr. Joseph Beacon by Name, about 5 o'clock in the morning,
as he lay, whether sleeping or waking he could not say (but he judged
the latter of them), had a view of his brother, then at London, although he
was himself at our Boston, distanc'd from him a thousand leagues. This his
brother appear'd to him in the morning (I say) about 5 o'clock, at Boston,
having on him a Bengale gown, which he usually wore, with a napkin ty'd about
his head; his <i>countenance</i> was very pale, ghastly, deadly, and he had a bloody
wound on the side of his forhead. 'Brother,' says the affrighted Joseph,
'Brother,' answered the apparition. Said Joseph, 'What's the matter
Brother? how came you here?' The apparition replied: 'Brother I have
been most barbarously and inhumanly murdered by a debauch'd fellow, to
whom I never did any wrong in my life.' Whereupon he gave a particular
description of the murderer; adding, 'Brother, this fellow, changing
his name, is attempting to come over to New England, in <i>Foy</i> or <i>Wild</i>: I
would pray you on the arrival of either of these, to get an order from the
governour to seize the person whom I now have describ'd, and then do
you indict him for the murder of your brother.' And so he vanished."
Mather then adds an account, which shows that Beacon's brother was
actually murdered as described, dying within the very hour in which his
apparition appeared in Boston. He says that the murderer was tried, but,
with the aid of his friends, saved his life. Joseph himself, our author
says, died "a pious and hopeful death," and gave him the account written
and signed with his own hand. And now, while New England history
abounds with stories like this, men incline to question an Icelandic writer,
because he occasionally indulges in fancies of the same sort. Rather should
we look for them, as authentic contemporary signs.</p></div>

Nauset, which Professor Agassiz proves to have existed. The writers
do not mention this island in either of the accounts of Thorfinn's voyage;
but it has been shown that Isle Nauset lay close to the shore, so that they
would not know that it <i>was</i> an island without particular examination; and
if they were aware of its existence, it was not necessary to speak of it. Leif
landed upon it, therefore it was mentioned by the author who wrote the
account of his voyage. Yet Thorfinn's chroniclers help to prove its existence,
by showing that beyond Wonder-strand there was a bay where they
could safely ride at anchor for three days.
</p><p>
It must be noticed that the events are not set down in their exact order,
for after the writer gets the vessels into the bay, he goes back to speak of
the landing of the Scots. Gosnold anchored in this same place in the night,
and in the morning he remarked the number of coves, or as he calls them
"breaches," in the land. The Saga mentions the same thing, saying that
the land "became indented with coves." These coves have now disappeared,
yet the testimony of Gosnold shows how accurately the Northmen observed
this part of the coast. Like Gosnold, they found it convenient and safe to
lie here for a while.</p></div>

into the hall of the gods. Next was Frigga or Frey, his wife, considered
the goddess of earth and mother of the gods. She finally fell into the
place occupied by the classic Venus. Next was Thor the Red-beard, synonymous
with Jupiter. These three composed the supreme council of the
gods. Afterwards came the good and gentle Balder, the Northman's
Christ; then came Brage, patron of eloquence and poetry, and his wife
Iduna, charged with the care of certain apples, with Heimdal the porter of

say how far the Saga writer employs his fancy on the Uniped, yet he is
quite excusable, considering the weakness of modern writers. In 1634,
Hans Egede wrote as follows about a hideous monster: "July 6th, a

water, that its head overtopped our mainsail.... Instead of fins, it had
broad flaps like wings; its body seemed to be overgrown like shell work....

above the water, a whole ship's length."&mdash;<i>Egede's Greenland</i>, p. 85; <i>Crantz's

Hortado, of Salmon Falls, was going with her husband "over the river in her
canoe, when they saw the head of a man, and about three foot off, the <i>tail</i> of
a cat, swimming before the canoe, but no body to join them.... A stone
thrown by an invisible hand after this, caus'd a swelling and a soreness in
her head: and she was <i>bitten</i> on both arms black and blue, and her breast

did not spread the news of her son's voyage in those parts of Europe
whither she went, and make known the discovery of the New World. To
this it may be replied, that the Icelanders had no idea that they had found
a New World, and did not appreciate the value of their geographical knowledge.
Besides, there is nothing to prove that Gudrid, and others who
went to Europe at this period, did <i>not</i> make known the Icelandic discoveries.
At that time no interest was taken in such subjects, and therefore
we have no right to expect to find traces of discussion in relation to what,
among a very small class, would be regarded, at the best, as a curious story.

Karlsefne (p. 63), this land was referred to by the natives whom he
took prisoners. They described it as a land inhabited by a people who
wore white clothes, carried poles before them, and shouted. Yet the Saga
writer there says no more than that the people <i>think</i> that this was the
place known as Ireland the Great. What the Skr&aelig;llings say does not
identify it with the land of Are Marson. Yet, in order to allow Professor
Rafn, who held that this country was America, the full benefit of his
theory, we give the following extract from Wafer's <i>Voyage</i>, which shows
that in the year 1681, when he visited the Isthmus of Darien, there were
people among the natives who answered tolerably well to the description
given in Karlsefne's narrative. Wafer says: "They are white, and there
are them of both sexes; yet there were few of them in comparison of the
copper colored, possibly but one, to two or three hundred. They differ
from the other Indians, chiefly in respect of color, though not in that only.
Their skins are not of such a white, as those of fair people among Europeans,
with some tincture of a blush or sanguine complexion; neither is
their complexion like that of our paler people, but 'tis rather a Milk-white,
lighter than the color of any Europeans, and much like that of a
white horse.... Their bodies are beset all over, more or less, with a fine,
short, milk-white down.... The men would probably have white bristles
for beards, did they not prevent them by their custom of plucking the
young beard up by the roots.... Their eyebrows are milk-white also, and
so is the hair of their heads." p. 107.
</p><p>
He also adds, that "The men have a value for Cloaths, and if any of
them had an old shirt given him by any of us, he would be sure to wear
it, and strut about at no ordinary rate. Besides this, they have a sort of
long cotton garments of their own, some white, and others of a rusty
black, shaped like our carter's frocks, hanging down to their heels, with a
fringe of the same of cotton, about a span long, and short, wide, open
sleeves, reaching but to the middle of their arms.... They are worn on
some great occasions.... When they are assembled, they will sometimes
walk about the place or plantation where they are, with these, their robes
on. And once I saw Tacenta thus walking with two or three hundred of
these attending him, as if he was mustering them. And I took notice that
those in the black gowns walked before him, and the white after him,
each having their lances of the same color with their robes." But notwithstanding
these resemblances, historians will ask for more solid proof of
the identity of the two people.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_223_223" id="Footnote_223_223"></a><a href="#FNanchor_223_223"><span class="label">[223]</span></a> Professor Rafn in, what seems to the author, his needless anxiety to
fix the locality of the White-man's land in America, says that, as this part
of the manuscript is difficult to decipher, the original letters <i>may</i> have got
changed, and vi inserted instead of xx, or xi, which numerals would afford
time for the voyager to reach the coast of America, in the vicinity of
Florida. Smith in his <i>Dialogues</i>, has even gone so far as to <i>suppress</i> the
term <i>six</i> altogether, and substitutes, "by a number of days sail unknown."
This is simply trifling with the subject. In <i>Gr&ouml;nland's Historiske Mindesm&aelig;rker</i>,
chiefly the work of Finn Magnussen, no question is raised on this
point. The various versions all give the number six, which limits the
voyage to the vicinity of the Azores. Sch&ouml;ning, to whom we are so largely
indebted for the best edition of Heimskringla, lays the scene of Marson's
adventure at those islands, and suggests that they may at that time have
covered a larger extent of territory than the present, and that they may have
suffered from earthquakes and floods, adding, "It is likely, and all circumstances
show, that the said land has been a piece of North America." This is a
bold, though not very unreasonable hypothesis, especially as the volcanic character
of the islands is well known. In 1808, a volcano rose to the height of
3,500 feet. Yet Sch&ouml;ning's suggestion is not needed. The fact that the
islands were not inhabited when discovered by the Portuguese does not,
however, settle anything against Sch&ouml;ning, because in the course of five
hundred years, the people might either have migrated, or been swept away
by pestilence. <i>Gr&ouml;nland's Historiske Mindesm&aelig;rker</i>, (vol. <span class="smcap">i</span>, p. 150), says
simply, that "It is <i>thought</i> that he (Are Marson) ended his days in America,
or at all events in one of the larger islands of the west. Some think that it
was one of the Azore islands."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_224_224" id="Footnote_224_224"></a><a href="#FNanchor_224_224"><span class="label">[224]</span></a> The fact that Are Marson is said to have been baptized in Ireland the
Great, does not prove that the place, wherever located, was inhabited by
a colony of Irish Christians. Yet this view was urged by Professor Rafn
and others, who held that Great Ireland was situated in Florida. A
Shawanese <i>tradition</i> is given to prove that Florida was early settled by
white men from over the sea. We read that in 1818, "the Shawanese were
established in Ohio, whither they came from Florida, Black Hoof, then
eighty-five years old, was born there, and remembered bathing in the sea.
He told the Indian Agent, that the people of his tribe had a tradition, that
their ancestors came over the sea, and that for a long time they kept a
yearly sacrifice for their safe arrival."&mdash;<i>Arch&aelig;ologia Americana</i>, vol. <span class="smcap">i</span>, p.
273. Yet these Indians, the supposed descendants of eminently pious
Christians from Ireland, were bitterly opposed to Christianity, and had no
Christian traditions. This view requires altogether too much credulity. Is
it not more reasonable, especially in view of the fact that this narrative is
not needed in demonstrating the pre-Columbian discovery of America&mdash;to
seek for the White-man's land in some island of the Atlantic; for if we
were to allow that six, should mean eleven or twenty days sail, we should
not be much better off, since there is so much difficulty in finding the white
men for the land in question.</p></div>

obscure or mythological character. In 981 he was one of the principal
men of Iceland, and is highly spoken of. Yet his connection with Ireland
the Great, though undoubtedly real, hardly <i>proves</i>, what may nevertheless
be true&mdash;a pre-Scandinavian discovery of America by the Irish. This, not
improbable view, demands clearer proof, and will repay investigation.

a castle was also built by King Harold Blaatand, of Denmark. It was
situated on one of the outlets of the Oder, on the coast of Pomerania. It
was probably identical with Julian, founded by the Wends, and was recognized
as the island of Wallin, which Adam of Bremen, in the eleventh
century, described as the largest and most flourishing commercial city in
Europe. Burislaus, king of the Wends, surrendered the neighboring
territory into the hands of Palnatoki, a great chief of Fionia, who was
pledged to his support. Accordingly he built a stronghold here, and
organized a band of pirates, <i>commonly</i> called vikings, though it must be
observed, that while every viking was a pirate, every pirate was not a
viking. Only those pirates of princely blood, were properly called vikings,
or sea-kings. The Jomsvikings were distinguished for their rare courage,
and for the fearlessness with which they faced death. They were governed
by strict laws, and hedged about by exact requirements, and were also, it is
said, pledged to celibacy. Jomsberg was destroyed about the year 1175,
by Waldemar the Great, of Denmark, aided by the princes of Germany and
the king of Barbarrossa. Those of the pirates who survived, escaped to a
place near the mouth of the Elbe, where a few years after, they were
annihilated by the Danes, who in the reign of Canute VI, completely
destroyed their stronghold. Accounts of their achievements may be found
in the Saga of King Olaf Tryggvesson, in vol. <span class="smcap">i</span>, of Laing's <i>Heimskringla</i>.
The Icelanders sometimes joined the Norway pirates, as was the case
with Bi&ouml;rn, but they did not fit out pirate ships. Palnatoki died in the
year 993.</p></div>

ships to their force. He was killed, as stated, in 984, in a battle with his

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_250_250" id="Footnote_250_250"></a><a href="#FNanchor_250_250"><span class="label">[250]</span></a> Markland (Woodland) was Nova Scotia, as we know from the description
of Leif and others. These vessels doubtless went to get timber. All
these accounts show that the Western ocean was generally navigated in the
middle of the fourteenth century.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_251_251" id="Footnote_251_251"></a><a href="#FNanchor_251_251"><span class="label">[251]</span></a> In the face of this and a multitude of similar statements, Mr. Bancroft
endeavors to make his readers believe that the locality of Vinland was
uncertain. He might, with equal propriety, tell us that the location of
Massachusetts itself was uncertain, because, according to the original grant,
it extended to the Pacific ocean.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_252_252" id="Footnote_252_252"></a><a href="#FNanchor_252_252"><span class="label">[252]</span></a> See note 1, p. 81.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_253_253" id="Footnote_253_253"></a><a href="#FNanchor_253_253"><span class="label">[253]</span></a> This is a blunder. The writer must have been more of a geographer
than historian. See the Saga of Leif, p. 36.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_254_254" id="Footnote_254_254"></a><a href="#FNanchor_254_254"><span class="label">[254]</span></a> The part inclosed in brackets is an interpolation of a recent date, and
without any authority.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_255_255" id="Footnote_255_255"></a><a href="#FNanchor_255_255"><span class="label">[255]</span></a> Not to be confounded with, the place of the same name at Cape Cod.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_256_256" id="Footnote_256_256"></a><a href="#FNanchor_256_256"><span class="label">[256]</span></a> This is another passage upon which Bancroft depends, to prove that the
locality of Vinland was unknown, when in the Sagas the position is minutely
described, the situation being as well known as that of Greenland.</p></div>
